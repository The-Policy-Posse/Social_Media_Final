## Reddit Data Collection

The `Reddit_Data_Scrapers` folder contains scripts designed for efficient and large-scale collection of Reddit posts and comments from state-specific subreddits. These scripts utilize multiple Reddit API keys to manage rate limits and optimize asynchronous data fetching.  They are configured to pull the top 600 threads/posts from the past year for the 50 state subreddits, and all of the comments (including nested comments) from those threads (around 4.5 million comments).  The comments script takes around 16 hours to run, posts is much faster.

### Files in the Folder
1. **`redditPostPull.py`**  
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves the top posts from specified state subreddits over the past year.  
   - **Output**: Saves collected posts to a CSV file (`reddit_posts.csv`).

2. **`redditCommentPull.py`**  
   - **Purpose**: Fetches all comments for posts collected by `redditPostPull.py`.  
   - **Output**: Saves comments to a CSV file (`reddit_comments.csv`), grouped by state.
   - (New York had an issue in data collection and has two specific scripts to append to the created dataframes)
