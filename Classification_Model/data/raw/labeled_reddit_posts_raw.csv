by eighteen, i am a grown ass man. i have left my home. i’m becoming financially independent.

there is no good reason that i can think of that i should be treated as a minor.

the ramifications of this are that:

1) i have to go out-of-state *every single time* i need to pick up my medication, as a *grown ass man,* because the alabama state legislature decided that, as a grown ass man, i am not mature enough to make decisions about my own healthcare with my doctor. 

2) i need to make money, so i just tried to sign up for doordash as a side hustle. guess what? even though i’d be allowed to sign up for doordash in my home state, in addition to practically every state in the united states of america, i’m not allowed to sign up for doordash. not until i’m 19.

but while i receive the lack of freedom of being a minor, i don’t receive any benefits of it. it’s not like my out-of-state parents can be obligated to pay for my food or housing anymore. 

i am a university student. i do not have parents in the state of alabama to fall back on. no one is holding my hand like a child. so why are my healthcare decisions being prohibited? why is my ability to make money being undermined?

i’m genuinely so frustrated and my frustration grows every single day.


—


EDIT: now that five hours have passed, i’m realizing that i seem so annoyed in this post. now, i am annoyed, but i wrote this directly after being denied from doordash for being 18, so i was a little heated at the time. 

i’ve had commenters confused about why i can’t pick up my medication. unfortunately, the state of alabama banned gender-affirming care for “minors” in 2022, and i’m considered a minor as an eighteen year old. it’s extremely frustrating to have become an adult and then become a child again when i stepped into alabama; it’s extremely frustrating to have the legislature stand between my doctor and i when i am federally considered an adult. just wanted to clear up that confusion.


—


EDIT 2: i’m getting the same type of comment over and over again, so i’m addressing them here.

⠀
> “then leave the state of alabama.”

i’m fond of alabama and particularly of my university here. i don’t regret my decision to come here. that doesn’t mean i have to agree or like every policy of the state.

⠀
> “why did you come here, then?”

i got a huge scholarship, and my brother lives here. i knew that this was the position of the state, so
i’m not *surprised* that this is my experience, but i’m still frustrated. the reason i decided to overlook it is because i’m not going to be eighteen forever. i turn nineteen before the end of the year and will be able to pick up my medication then. it’s just a pain in the meantime. just because i knew about this issue beforehand doesn’t mean it’s not infuriating; it doesn’t mean i can’t discuss the absurdity of it.

most people who are asking this question aren’t just referring to the heightened age of majority, but about why i would come to alabama as a trans person. my answer is the same as above, but i’d also like to add that driving trans people out of alabama is exactly what these laws are designed to do. **putting the blame on trans people for existing in alabama instead of on the state legislature for their discriminatory legislative record blows my mind.**

⠀
> “18 is not a grown man.” / “you sound immature.”

you don’t have to think that i sound mature to agree that, by the age that most adults move out of their parents’ house, they should have the rights of an adult. there are plenty of other adults i find to be immature, but i don’t think that their rights and autonomy should be taken away on that basis. i’m financially independent and living independently. i *had* legal autonomy just before i crossed state lines into alabama. so bizarre.

⠀
> “can you try a mail-in pharmacy?”

yes, i’m going to look into it, thanks to you guys! much appreciated.


also, just so you guys know the kind of responses i’m dealing with: somebody here called me mentally ill and then proceeded to blocked ME when i civilly asked to have an actual conversation with them. i can’t imagine leaving a hate comment and then blocking that person because i’m scared of actually talking to them. made me laugh.","i ’ be here for university from out - of - state, where the age of majority be 18, just like almost every single state in addition to the federal age of majority. by eighteen, i be a grow ass man. i have leave my home. i ’ be become financially independent. there be no good reason that i can think of that i should be treat as a minor. the ramification of this be that: 1 ) i have to go out - of - state * every single time * i need to pick up my medication, as a * grow ass man, * because the alabama state legislature decide that, as a grow ass man, i be not mature enough to make decision about my own healthcare with my doctor. 2 ) i need to make money, so i just try to sign up for doordash as a side hustle. guess what? even though i ’ have be allow to sign up for doordash in my home state, in addition to practically every state in the unite state of america, i ’ be not allow to sign up for doordash. not until i ’ be 19. but while i receive the lack of freedom of be a minor, i don ’ t receive any benefit of it. it ’ s not like my out - of - state parent can be obligate to pay for my food or house anymore. i be a university student. i do not have parent in the state of alabama to fall back on. no one be hold my hand like a child. so why be my healthcare decision be prohibit? why be my ability to make money be undermine? i ’ be genuinely so frustrate and my frustration grow every single day. — EDIT: now that five hour have pass, i ’ be realize that i seem so annoy in this post. now, i be annoy, but i write this directly after be deny from doordash for be 18, so i be a little heat at the time. i ’ have have commenters confuse about why i can ’ t pick up my medication. unfortunately, the state of alabama ban gender - affirm care for “ minor ” in 2022, and i ’ be consider a minor as a eighteen year old. it ’ s extremely frustrate to have become a adult and then become a child again when i step into alabama; it ’ s extremely frustrate to have the legislature stand between my doctor and i when i be federally consider a adult. just want to clear up that confusion. — EDIT 2: i ’ be get the same type of comment over and over again, so i ’ be address them here. ⠀ > “ then leave the state of alabama. ” i ’ be fond of alabama and particularly of my university here. i don ’ t regret my decision to come here. that doesn ’ t mean i have to agree or like every policy of the state. ⠀ > “ why do you come here, then? ” i get a huge scholarship, and my brother life here. i know that this be the position of the state, so i ’ be not * surprise * that this be my experience, but i ’ be still frustrate. the reason i decide to overlook it be because i ’ be not go to be eighteen forever. i turn nineteen before the end of the year and will be able to pick up my medication then. it ’ s just a pain in the meantime. just because i know about this issue beforehand doesn ’ t mean it ’ s not infuriate; it doesn ’ t mean i can ’ t discuss the absurdity of it. much people who be ask this question aren ’ t just refer to the heighten age of majority, but about why i would come to alabama as a trans person. my answer be the same as above, but i ’ have also like to add that drive trans people out of alabama be exactly what this law be design to do. * * putting the blame on trans people for exist in alabama instead of on the state legislature for their discriminatory legislative record blow my mind. * * ⠀ > “ 18 be not a grow man. ” / “ you sound immature. ” you don ’ t have to think that i sound mature to agree that, by the age that much adult move out of their parent ’ house, they should have the right of a adult. there be plenty of other adult i find to be immature, but i don ’ t think that their right and autonomy should be take away on that basis. i ’ be financially independent and live independently. i * have * legal autonomy just before i cross state line into alabama. so bizarre. ⠀ > “ can you try a mail - in pharmacy? ” yes, i ’ be go to look into it, thank to you guy! much appreciate. also, just so you guy know the kind of response i ’ be deal with: somebody here call me mentally ill and then proceed to block ME when i civilly ask to have a actual conversation with them. i can ’ t imagine leave a hate comment and then block that person because i ’ be scare of actually talk to them. make me laugh.","Alabama","I HATE THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN THIS STATE.","I HATE THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN THIS STATE.","{""choices"":[""Health and Healthcare"",""Crime and Law Enforcement""]}","2024-11-15T03:29:54.445497Z","https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/1g84h6n/i_hate_the_age_of_majority_in_this_state/"

Said land is located right at the I-22 corridor intersecting Alabama state Highway 13. For some reason because of the land's location between I-22 and Hwy 13, some ancient law from 1780's  U.S. Articles of Confederation times (the U.S. one, not the Confederacy), only the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR) is allowed to manage, lease of sell the land, even though the Franklin County school system technically owns it.

Basically, the Franklin County wants to be able to sell the land they already own, which is already located in a different county so have no use for it, on order to to better fund their school system that's actually located in Franklin County. 

It's actually prime land to sell located right at the I-22 corridor at an Intestate exit intersecting a state highway.

So yea, normally I don't vote on statewide amendments on local/county issues bc I just think it's stupid in principle. However, Franklin County should be able to sell land they own and have no use for. 

It's not pristine protected land or anythjng, it's just undeveloped land right next to the Interstate, so there's no environmental or conservation concerns. Franklin County's school system should be able to fetch a nice price for it, and they have the right to be able to.

Time Off Allotted: An employee who is a registered voter and who provides reasonable notice to his/her employer, can take up to one hour off of work to vote in a primary or general election. The employer may specify the hour during which the employee may be absent for voting.


Wages: The statute does not specify whether the absence must be paid.


Exception: An employer is not required to provide voting leave if the employee’s shift begins at least two hours after the polls open or ends at least two hours before the polls close.


Notice Requirement: An employee must give reasonable notice to his/her employer.


The statute does not specify a penalty for employers failing to allow this.

Deputy party leader Marjorie Taylor Green recently confirmed on X (love you Elon!) what we all had suspected: Hurricane Milton was created by Democrats using advanced military technology to steal the election. As Alaskans, we know this means HAARP, just as we know the Republican party to be an irrefutable source of truth which should never be questioned.

But it still left me wondering how exactly do they create the hurricane using HAARP? According to wikipedia, HAARP is run by a well-known CIA/DoD front organization, the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It uses high frequency transmitters to excite the atmosphere. But my question is, how does exciting the atmosphere above Fairbanks cause a hurricane all the way down in Florida? And how do they make it so it only targets Republicans?

Does anyone like maybe a physicist or someone who was employed at UAF know how this whole thing works? I tried to do my own research by ordering Begich Sr.'s book from Nick's web site, but they said it was out of print (almost certainly due to CIA interference). Also, does anyone know if this could be connected to the wind storm that ripped the roof off my house a few winters back?

-it discourages Natives from even posting here, which...

-decreases diversity and inclusion, which allows harm in real life to continue and grow as folks remain ignorant without being exposed to our issues, viewpoints, and cultures.

-and it will ultimately make our community, here and other places, worse off.

First, yes I know that 5 days is cutting it very close and involves a ton of driving each day. I am still working on trying to get an extra day or two from work, but I am kinda stuck with the timing for the time being and just want any advice to make it the most smooth!

Second, given my timing I know I will not have much time to stop places on the way up, but I will be driving back down in August with tons of time to stop places so I will be holding recommendations on cool places to stop in mind!

Third, my bf will be driving up and back down with me so I am not alone and I have also had tons of experiences driving far distances. Driving is therapy to me and I don't find it or nature a burden. Rather, I believe as long as I respect nature for all its glory and power I will be ok. I also have prepped my car to be in tip top shape and replaced a whole bunch of stuff in preparation.

The old election system with closed primaries certainly helped the Republicans stay in control. A small group of party leaders could essentially dictate which candidates made it to the general election and if you stepped out of line, that was it. Game over.

I think parties are still coasting on that old power but it's starting to burn off since we changed to Ranked Choice Voting and open primaries.

The veto override vote today was disheartening but it also showed how little unity exists in the Alaska Republican Party right now. Out of 33 Republicans in the legislature, only 20 supported Governor Dunleavy. They're not exactly marching in lockstep.

This recent polling by Data for Progress was quite interesting as well. It points to Alaskans being overwhelmingly in favor of progressive policies -- things like a very large BSA increase, child care subsidies and other social programs, etc -- and despite all that, there's a preference for the worst of the worst conservative candidates amongst the same sample group.

It's like we're not quite connecting policy to people. Hopefully we can do a little better in the next election cycle.

Governor Dumleavy, who took office in December 2018, addressed Alaskans in a somber press conference held at the Governor's Mansion in Juneau. Flanked by members of his administration, Dumleavy spoke candidly about his decision to step down from office.

""""It is with a heavy heart and deep humility that I announce my resignation as the Governor of Alaska,"""" said Dumleavy, his voice tinged with remorse. """"Over the past few years, it has become increasingly clear to me that I am not equipped with the necessary skills and competence to effectively lead this great state.""""

Dumleavy, a former teacher and state senator, rose to prominence with promises of fiscal responsibility and conservative governance. However, his tenure has been marred by controversy and political division. His administration faced widespread criticism for budget cuts to essential services, including education and healthcare, as well as a tumultuous relationship with the state legislature.

""""I deeply regret the pain and hardship that my decisions have inflicted upon the people of Alaska,"""" Dumleavy continued. """"I entered this office with the best intentions, but I now recognize that I have fallen short of the expectations entrusted to me by the citizens of this state.""""

The announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from both within and outside his party, as well as ongoing investigations into alleged misconduct and misuse of state resources. While Governor Dumleavy did not explicitly address these allegations, his resignation signals a willingness to take responsibility for his shortcomings.

In the wake of Dumleavy's resignation, Lieutenant Governor Kevin Meyer will assume the duties of the governorship. Meyer, a seasoned politician with extensive experience in state government, expressed his commitment to guiding Alaska through this transition period.

""""I want to assure the people of Alaska that my administration will work tirelessly to address the challenges facing our state and to restore trust in our government,"""" said Lieutenant Governor Meyer in a statement following the announcement.

As a skater in the community it has been super disappointing to get my hopes up for this park & have it never happen. Even sadder is I’ve spoken to 20 year olds who remember being elementary school children that were promised the park, were very much looking forward to it & then never got one. There are many reasons why this skatepark would be great for our community: give older kids a place to build their skills & confidence once they’ve outgrown the playground, fostering the skating community, health benefits of exercise & being outdoors, getting rid of a dangerous, useless area, and of course, it would just be really fun. 

In the last couple months the project has finally gained momentum again!! The Skatepark has gotten a new head, new committee & has teamed up with Grindline, a company that builds skateparks. They just built the awesome new Taku park in Anchorage as well as one in Sitka. We are determined to finally make it happen!!!

I wanted to post on here to keep other Alaskans in the loop about it, this can’t happen without the support of people in our community. We’ve created a Facebook group Talkeetna Skatepark & an instagram @tkaskatepark if you’d like to follow for updates. 

If you live in Talkeetna or nearby or just want to support the skatepark there will be a big collaborative community meeting on Monday, November 11th starting 5pm at the Sheldon Arts Hangar in Talkeetna.

I am a lifetime valley resident who decided to go on a hike at the base of the superstitions tonight. I checked the forecast and everything seemed all clear so I packed up and went out. 

It was a pretty short 2 mile trial and at about 1.5 miles in I had stopped to shine my headlamp on a wooden post to make sure I was on trail. 

Suddenly about 50 feet in front of me I hear the sound of something falling and hitting the ground and rocks tumbling all around that area. Immediately after I hear a sort of chuffing sound clearly coming from an unidentified medium-large sized mammal. 

I decide it’s probably not a predator but just in case I startled and pissed it off I grab a rock and slowly walk backwards for about two minutes. 

After I’ve determined it’s not following me I call my girlfriend for an update and a laugh. Suddenly while I’m on the phone it gets very windy and the temperature drops about 20 degrees in two minutes. 

It starts to sprinkle and she tells me a large storm cell is headed my way. Concerned about flash floods I stick to high ground and move quickly and as I’m walking checking behind my shoulder every minute or two.

At some point I look to my right and see what almost looks like an aluminum foil kite reflecting off my headlight. It seems to vanish after a second and I look away thinking I’ve imagined it. I glance in that direction and see it is still there and emitting its own bluish light. It kind of looks like someone else’s flashlight and it’s less than 100 feet away from my off trail. 

Suddenly i kid you not it shoots up into the sky so quickly I thought someone had turned their flashlight up to the sky and it was reflecting off the bottom of the clouds. 

It disappeared after 3-4 seconds in the clouds. I realize it would have to be an incredibly strong flashlight to reflect off the cloud so visibly especially without growing larger as it went further (it remained seemingly the same size). 

Im not certain at all what I saw but im guessing it may have been ball lightning. Anyways I made it to the end of the trail safely just as the storm cell got overhead and starting dumping on me. Fortunately totally fine but definitely a weird night 😂.

Edit: I am 100 percent certain I did not encounter the supernatural or an alien lol. After looking online I’m guessing the animal was a javelina and I’m about 80 percent certain I saw ball lightning.

I'm about to go on a long sappy rant here.

I grew up exclusively in suburban hell in Northern Kentucky. I then lived in New York and New Jersey. I relocated to Oro Valley, AZ with my father this April. And before that I was... frightened. I hate the heat and enjoy verdant landscapes. I held the stereotypical image of Arizona that I think most east coasters and outsiders have- that AZ was a dry, brown, and featureless desert. I was worried that the environment and landscape would drain me, as I'm very easily affected by the aesthetics of my surroundings. 

I'm a sucker for natural beauty and love geography, but I never really experienced it much firsthand as an adult. We flew from Salt Lake City to Tucson and I got the pleasure of a window seat. Seeing the sky islands suddenly jolt out of the mostly flat landscape around Tucson on our descent quite genuinely brought tears to my eyes. I've never lived in a place with mountains and seeing the dramatic landscape from the air was sincerely a moving experience.  

I am madly, deeply enamored with every detail of the scenery where I live. I am legitimately obsessed with Saguaro cactuses and the uniqueness of the landscape they inhabit. The scale of the mountains and valleys, the sunsets, the monsoons, never fail to leave me completely gobsmacked. 

And then, I took a road trip from Tucson up to Flagstaff. You're telling me you people nonchalantly drive up I-17 and *SAY NOTHING?!* I'm a staunch atheist and became religious about six times that entire drive. Perhaps it's the fact I'm used to the monotonous east coast terrain and hold a special love for natural beauty, but my mouth was WIDE open the entire 4 hour trip. The feeling of being in the wilderness among massive mountains and saguaros, the wide open stretches of land, the mind-bending descent into the Verde Valley, the intense scent of pine and clean air in Flagstaff, the expansive fields of wildflowers and meadows, the sheer breadth of space and wilderness... My friend and I just kept repeating how we couldn't believe this was Arizona. 

I had no idea. Zero. Zilch. Expectations shattered to pieces. I can easily say my limited time here in Oro Valley and Arizona in general has been life-altering in the best way possible. Just a trip to the grocery store passing the mountains and seeing the sun shine in the valley has brought tears to my eyes and filled me with joy.

Has anyone else who moved here have a similar shocking experience? Or am I just being corny?","That Arizona be a total treasure trove of unique and breathtaking scenery?

We had a group meeting with all thos in charge of these ballot initiatives and have decided to abandon the county we are working in.  We spoke to Over 70 people in 5 hours today(6/26) and only got 3 signatures. I'm really sorry to say this, but as far as this specific county goes, Red won, they have the populus so scared to even sign a petition, that they will never be taken out of power without legal intervention.   The good thing is that we only need a small number of signatures in a few other counties to reach the ultimate goal.  We WILL get these issues on the ballot despite their best efforts to stop it. 


I am currently working with a group to gather signatures for ballot initiatives. I am noticing a major trend. We all hear about how low the education level is in Arkansas.  And I'm seeing it first hand.  The majority of the people I have spoken to this week are Boomers. 70-90 year olds. They have no idea at all how a ballot initiative works. They full believe that a signature is a vote. They fully believe that everyone can see everything they """"vote"""" for. And they have absolutely no idea what the current laws are.  

Folks we have a major, and I mean major problem.  These are the people who educated the educators.  I don't mean this in an attackg way, but it's disturbing how proud they are of their own ignorance.  I had a very wealthyan argue with me that any woman could walk into any hospital and get an abortion at any time.  These are the people leading cities, playing President and CEO of corporations, one was a city attorney, who flat out said a pink tax does not exist.   

This state is in major trouble.  I don't understand how to help a populus that refuses education at every single turn. Doing this job has me questioning if this states people are even worth helping. They are so extremely rude and hateful. ","EDIT / UPDATE: We have a group meet with all thos in charge of this ballot initiative and have decide to abandon the county we be work in. We speak to Over 70 people in 5 hour today ( 6 / 26 ) and only get 3 signature. I'm really sorry to say this, but as far as this specific county go, Red win, they have the populus so scare to even sign a petition, that they will never be take out of power without legal intervention. The good thing be that we only need a small numb of signature in a few other county to reach the ultimate goal. We WILL get this issue on the ballot despite their good effort to stop it. I be currently work with a group to gather signature for ballot initiative. I be notice a major trend. We all hear about how low the education level be in Arkansas. And I'm see it first hand. The majority of the people I have speak to this week be boomer. 70 - 90 year old. They have no idea at all how a ballot initiative work. They full believe that a signature be a vote. They fully believe that everyone can see everything they "" "" vote "" "" for. And they have absolutely no idea what the current law be. folk we have a major, and I mean major problem. this be the people who educate the educator. I don't mean this in a attackg way, but it's disturb how proud they be of their own ignorance. I have a very wealthyan argue with me that any woman can walk into any hospital and get a abortion at any time. this be the people lead city, play President and CEO of corporation, one be a city attorney, who flat out say a pink tax do not exist.

Do you ever feel like state politics and federal politics tend to leave you out? Regardless of your political affiliation, do you really, genuinely feel like your elected officials reflect your values and your needs and those of your greater community?

Personally, I feel like there is this ongoing issue of local politicians and officials latching onto national party politics and pushing those big loud ideas with no substance that don’t really help out the small folk. 

I feel like we as Arkansans need a platform that allows us to get loud and force our officials to listen to what we really need.

For instance, all over the state, infrastructure continues to collapse. Water, roads, bridges, you name it. Many communities, mine included, suffer from an extremely aged and overworked water infrastructure that can’t handle the current demand of a slowly shrinking town. How can we expect to grow in the future with crumbling infrastructure?

It’s been an issue for decades and my local politicians continue to worry about pushing church doctrine in the government. Look at their ads. You never see what they plan to do to help out your town. Just “I’ll fight the libruhls!”

Once she began working, she started to feel unusually faint. As the hours wore on, she told her co-workers she wasn’t feeling well, and retreated to a bathroom for rest. But the store was short-staffed, and her manager allegedly told her to “pull herself together.”

>Janikka had heart problems and diabetes—conditions management was aware of—and had worked through ailments before, because that’s the norm at Walmart. As recently as 2019, the company allowed employees to accrue nine penalizing points every six months before firing them. Today, it’s five. Workers receive those points for a whole host of reasons, like showing up late, leaving early, or taking unplanned time off, even if they’re sick or need to attend an important family function. 

>But Janikka rarely missed work or went home early. She once left her own birthday party to go to work, leaving loved ones to vent that Walmart was taking too much of her time. One of her sons, Austin, once pleaded with his mom to quit. “She was like, ‘Who else is going to pay the bills and put clothes on your back?’” he said. “I couldn’t say nothing else.” 

…

>Janikka spent many of her final years in between the walls of that store. But after her death, people there seemed afraid to talk about her. During a fall 2022 reporting trip, over a dozen associates at the supercenter declined to participate in this story when asked if they knew Janikka. I met one woman folding jeans who seemed open to talking, but seconds later, a store manager approached us and said that associates are prohibited from speaking with journalists on the clock. “You’re putting her at risk of getting in trouble,” the manager said. Then she called the police.

>This isn’t the only way in which Janikka has been disappeared: Her death does not appear in federal workplace fatality data, and her heart attack does not show up in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s records, according to the agency. As a result, the agency never investigated her death

…

>Walmart did not respond to most questions for this story. “Janikka Perry was a beloved member of the North Little Rock team,” a company spokesperson wrote in a statement. She added that our characterization of Janikka’s passing is “simply not true,” but did not provide a reason why and cited employee privacy concerns. She did not respond to multiple follow-ups asking her to specify which claims the company disputes. 

…

>A Walmart bakery can be a particularly difficult part of the store to work in: Janikka worked mostly on her feet, often in hot and cold conditions. Bakery staff haul heavy pallets of food out from the freezer, and some tend to an oven in the store’s poorly ventilated bakery, according to Cara Michelle, who filled Janikka’s position after her death. “It gets extremely hot back there,” she told me.

>According to workers I spoke to, managers have some discretion over how they deal with an associate’s issues. One store manager (who was also Janikka’s friend) was uniquely sensitive to Janikka’s conditions. He often let her take short breaks so she could go to the bathroom to sit down and rest. But he left early during her last shift. Still, that day, Janikka told management she was feeling sick. In response, she was told that the store was short-staffed and she needed to keep working, according to store sources and an organizer from United for Respect, a nonunion group that emerged from an unsuccessful campaign to unionize the company and now organizes for workers’ rights there. 

…

>Zena Green, another former North Little Rock associate, added that management “didn’t accept doctor’s notes.” 

…

>These types of worker concerns are exacerbated in a state like Arkansas, which has no paid sick leave laws for private employees on the books.

…

>Before she called 911 on the night of her death, Janikka languished in the bathroom for nearly an hour and a half. While it’s unclear what accounts for that delay, associates from her store and others say that in general, they’re discouraged from calling for emergency help on the clock without talking to a manager first.

>In some cases, they’re disciplined for it. “I had an associate once call 911, and she was written up for not talking to a manager first,” one of Janikka’s co-workers told me, echoing reports of claims from other associates and customers. In a particularly fraught 2018 case, ABC15 reported that an Arizona customer claimed that a Walmart employee physically prevented her from calling 911 after another employee collapsed to the ground.

…

>In the days after Janikka died, and in the two years since, Walmart has largely brushed the incident under the rug. When her sisters sought information on her final hours directly from the store, they say, a manager named Jason called the police and told them to get a subpoena. Jason did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him. 

>The sisters ended up piecing together a few details by talking to skittish co-workers, with the help of United for Respect. Some said Walmart had told them to keep quiet about the incident. (Walmart did not comment on what it communicated to Janikka’s co-workers after her death.) 

…

>“Our whole economy here in Arkansas is tied to this organization, so you can’t really get a fair trial,” said a former company official, who still works in the state and requested anonymity to protect their current professional role.

…

>OSHA’s inspection reports from Arkansas do not provide much insight into Walmart’s worker safety practices there. From 2012 to 2022, OSHA launched just eight Walmart inspections in Arkansas. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the agency provided records for just three of these cases, explaining that the others had been destroyed per government retention policies. (At least two of the cases, both out of Bentonville, were new enough to mandate preservation, but OSHA officials could not explain why they were destroyed.)

>Jessica Martinez, co–executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health National, said OSHA is underfunded and overwhelmed, making it nearly impossible to effectively oversee Walmart’s behavior.

One of them was a new map of the Ozarks. 

The planning committee for the Ozarks Program wanted to create a new map of the region specifically for this Festival program, and we commissioned Curtis Copeland to work with the committee on the design and details. Copeland is a GIS Manager for the City of Branson, and he was instrumental in the revitalization of the Society of Ozarkian Hillcrofters. The Ozarks Studies Institute, an ongoing initiative of the Missouri State University Libraries, paid Copeland to design and fine-tune the new map. 

The boundaries of the Ozark region always have been open to debate and discussion. Most previous maps of the Ozarks tended to use bold, solid lines as a border for the region. The new map uses a hashed line to indicate that the boundaries are a bit murky and fluid.

The southern boundary of the multi-state region had bothered several members of the planning committee for years. Rachel Reynolds took it upon herself to drive along the southern boundary of the Ozarks and try to establish a more defensible southern border. 

The biggest difference between the new map and other maps of the region, however, is the inclusion of portions of southern Illinois as part of the Ozarks region. This has generated some lively discussion on social media. 

A large printed version of the map was brought back from DC and is on display in the Ozarks Room on the Third Level of Duane G. Meyer Library on the main Springfield campus of Missouri State University.

You can do this. Below is a prompt u can use if you are a nervous Nelly on the phone like me.

Hello,

My name is ————— and I am a citizen/voter in the state of Arkansas. I find it concerning that your office has not counted the signatures for the Arkansas abortion amendment. 

Arkansas is number 1 in the nation for maternal mortality. This means we have the highest death rate for pregnant people due to complications from pregnancy and birth. 

Additionally, about half of our counties are without OBGYNs. This means about half of our state does not have adequate access to care during pregnancy. It is not safe to be pregnant in Arkansas. 

Over 100 thousand Arkansan voters from 50+ counties signed the amendment to put this issue on the ballot. According to the Arkansas constitution your office is required to count the signatures.

I implore you to follow our constitution, count the signatures and put this issue on the ballot. 

Thank you!

Hope this helps. Now go call Thurston’s office. 📱

They're going to try again! I'm surprised they waited this long after his reelection, because the first Newsom recall attempt started soon after his first election. And then they kept trying. After several attempts they only barely succeeded because a judge gave them several extra months. And that recall failed miserably.

So why try again? I watched a little of the group's video and their only new complaint seems to be his supposed presidential aspirations. So my theory is that they want to tarnish his national reputation.

But I don't see the enthusiasm that the last recall attempt had. Will there be lots of recall tables with tents, and lots of flags, and groups of people waving and yelling on the roadsides?

First, job opportunities. Connecticut has a ton of them. I work for a large company with great benefits and salary. There are many jobs like mine open within my company and in the state.
Second: infrastructure, specifically roads, anyone who complains about roads in ct has never driven on i80 or i4 in pa and fl respectively two of the worst roads you'll ever find yourself on. i4 is one of the most dangerous stretches of interstate in the country, and i80 is in a level of disrepair that rivals a lot of dirt roads. 

One last positive about CT, specifically if you're a veteran. You can get a tax break on your vehicle and property taxes here, and if you have a disability rating, the discount is even better plus you can get your bachelors or graduate degree from a state school for FREE you dont even have to be a resident you just have to live in the state for a year.

I’ll do my best to keep it short as I can! If you can be patient with me then wonderful! I’m not a weirdo, just someone with a plethora of learning disorders.

My spouse recently got a job in Bristol as a broadcast engineer at Disney + ESPN. We currently live in northeast Louisiana. We have lived here our entire lives, so I’m guessing there will be culture shock. We move in 8 weeks. I’m so scared. I have both depression and anxiety. We are going into this blind so far. But the job is helping us with “relocation services” so there’s that much. We’ll also need to find a good sized storage facility as we’re moving from a 4 bed/2 bath home. We can’t afford a house anytime soon, so we’ll have to have somewhere to put our furniture until we can actually buy a house.

I’m excited for the opportunity, I’m just really scared and sad about leaving my family behind. I suffer from deep depression, so I have to be careful with my time otherwise I’ll just hide away in our rental/home forever instead of actually going out and seeing what this new place has to offer.  

Off the top of your head, can you think of things I should expect upon moving there? Or things I don’t know but should? I have a few more questions…  

I don’t work. What all can I do while my spouse is working to keep me busy? I’m not much of an outdoors person, but I don’t mind if I’m with someone who is experienced in that area that can help me avoid getting mauled by a bear. Are the people nice? I’m pretty friendly, literally anybody that meets my spouse loves them, but someone told me that the people weren’t nice. I know cost of living is higher, we’ve been saving a bit to help us in the transition phase. My spouse will be paid decent, so I’m not so worried about finances in the long run.  

I hear there’s a bigger Jewish community than what we have right now. My rabbi knows another rabbi there, so I’m sure that’s where I’ll go. But would I be able to wear my Star of David necklace safely? It’s getting dangerous to be Jewish here. Someone told me that it’s not a religious area, so I’m REALLY glad to move to an area where I won’t get harassed by Jesus everywhere I go. We are very liberal, so I’m SO glad to finally be moving to a blue state. 

How do I make friends? I don’t want to be a hermit like I am here. I want this to be my second chant at a happy life. Does anybody know what the Disney + ESPN campus is like? At some point, I also could really use recommendations for things like a wonderful doctor, a psych to continue my meds for mental health, best place to buy groceries, best pharmacy, or anything of that nature.  

I can’t think of anything else right now. If anybody can answer some of these, I would be so grateful. You can PM me if you like. I don’t have much to offer you for your kindness, so please accept this offering in the form of a photo of my good boy in his raincoat and his signature head tilt!

After a five-year legal battle, the U.S. District Court recently ruled that transgender people incarcerated in Connecticut prisons are entitled to gender-affirming health care. 

Veronica-May Clark originally filed the case in 2019, and the American Civil Liberties Union offered her representation in 2021. Clark, who has been in custody since 2007, alleges that after a diagnosis of gender dysphoria — a medical diagnosis for someone who experiences distress that can occur when their true gender does not match with their outward appearance and/or the sex they were assigned at birth — her treatment from the Department of Correction was inconsistent. 

“At the end of the day, she just wants health care,” Elana Bildner, Clark’s attorney with the CT ACLU, told The Connecticut Mirror. “She wants the health care to be consistent, to be adequate, to be appropriate \[and\] to be able to rely on the fact that she will get this health care that she needs for the long term.”

As a result of the DOC’s continued delay of her requests, she says, her symptoms worsened, and she experienced serious self-harm and hospitalization.

I have worked from home for the past 8 years. Recently I started going back into the office in Hartford. I have a 30-minute drive. I was absolutely blown away by how terrible CT drivers have become in a short amount of time.

I was tailgated relentlessly while passing, cruising in the middle, or even being pokey in the slow lane.

People barely stop at stop signs before turning out onto a road. They sometimes don't even look at all and just enter traffic. what the fuck?

Almost every car I glance into I see the driver on their phone. If you leave any amount of open space between the car you're following, someone will force their way in, so you can't follow by the recommended 3 seconds. If you leave an open gap in front of you, the car behind you will practically enter your backseat.

Traffic on 91 in the passing lane is easily 90mph on average. Left lane camping has become so common that I regularly see people passing on the shoulder, in the middle lane, giving brake jobs to campers, and nearly pitting vehicles that camp the left lane. Every day I see at least 10 cars flying in and out of traffic like they're involved in a jewelry heist or something.

I hardly ever see people pulled over by police on the highway anymore nor do I see police sitting in the usual radar locations waiting to nab someone.

No one uses turn signals anymore. I'm a super defensive driver and I've always assumed the worst of other drivers every time I've gotten in a car since the time I was 16, but now as a grown adult, I'm terrified of other drivers. More so than ever before.

More DUI's, more wrong way accidents, more pedestrians and construction workers getting hit and killed, and nothing seems to be changing. It's just getting worse. Is this a sign that our society is falling apart morally?

It just seems like no one else cares about anyone else. It's me me me. People will pull out later and later in front of you, cutting you off with less and less time to react because they don't care/know that you even exist. It seems they're solely focused on themselves and don't grasp that other people are alive and occupy the same roadways. I've seen a car pull out in front of a UHaul giving the drive no time to react, and go off the road into a ditch. The driver that caused this just slowly drove away, seemingly oblivious to anything in their rear-view mirror.  Zero fucks given.

I asked ChatGPT a pretty open-ended question on this topic, just out of curiosity and it gave me the following output.

The increase in aggressive driving behaviors in Connecticut, and in many places, can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Stress and Rushed Lifestyles**: Many people feel pressured by tight schedules and busy lives, which can lead to impatience on the road.
2. **Distractions**: The widespread use of smartphones has significantly increased distractions while driving. Texting, social media, and calls can divert attention from the road.
3. **Traffic Volume**: Growing populations and urbanization can lead to more cars on the road, resulting in congestion that frustrates drivers and can lead to aggressive behaviors.
4. **Cultural Attitudes**: Some communities may have a more aggressive driving culture, where speeding and risky maneuvers are seen as normal.
5. **Lack of Enforcement**: Inconsistent traffic law enforcement can embolden aggressive drivers, as they may feel they can get away with dangerous behaviors.

# What Can Be Done

1. **Increased Enforcement**: Law enforcement can implement stricter penalties for aggressive driving behaviors, such as speeding, running red lights, and distracted driving.
2. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Educational campaigns can raise awareness about the dangers of aggressive driving and promote safer driving habits.
3. **Improved Infrastructure**: Enhancing road design, adding signage, and optimizing traffic signals can help manage traffic flow and reduce frustration.
4. **Encouraging Patience**: Community programs that promote patience and understanding on the road can help shift attitudes toward more courteous driving.
5. **Technology Solutions**: Encouraging the use of hands-free devices and apps that minimize distractions can help reduce the temptation to use phones while driving.

By addressing these underlying issues and promoting safer driving habits, communities can work towards reducing aggressive driving behaviors.

I've changed how I drive, to constantly be looking out for disaster. Waiting to go when it turns green making sure some idiot isn't going to blow the red. Triple and quadruple checking when changing lanes. Head on a swivel, constantly scanning in every direction to be fully aware of my surroundings. Had a 3-hour ride home from the Catskills yesterday, and by the time I pulled into my driveway I was fucking exhausted. It's EXHAUSTING to have to drive like this.

What can we do? Do we need to start having conversations with our family members on safe driving tips? Do we need to demand that driver's license requirements are significantly elevated in the state? Do we need to start shaming law enforcement for not doing enough? Are their driver education campaigns? Do fines need to be SIGNIFICANTLY increased in order to deter people? e.g., $1000 fine for being on a phone while driving?

Maybe some [frontier justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1hZ5drl0_s)?

I used to love driving and am a car guy through and through, but this is nuts.

At what point do """"the people"""" give up on elected officials and law enforcement to help resolve this issue and start taking matters into their own hands? I'm not sure another Reddit thread on this topic will help, but I'm interested in taking this to our state legislators, protesting, whatever it takes. Sometimes the people in the community can't just expect government to do it all, and I think we're actually well beyond that point.

Our people; our loved ones, are fucking dying out there and I'm tired of hearing about it, reading about it and being witness to it. Anyone willing to work together to build a community voice that we can then bring to our elected officials with recommendations?

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case Monday challenging Connecticut legislation that repealed religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements in 2021. In a lawsuit, three Connecticut parents and two organizations, We the Patriots USA, Inc., and the CT Freedom Alliance, had argued that the state was violating their First Amendment rights with its passage of Public Act 21-6, which eliminated the ability for Connecticut families to apply for a religious exemption to mandated immunizations when a student is enrolling in school. 

The plaintiffs sued the state departments of education and public health, the Office of Early Childhood Development and three local boards of education.

Brian Festa, co-founder and vice president of the nonprofit, called the Supreme Court’s decision “disappointing,” and “heinous.” But the battle is not over for Festa’s organization.

Festa said one claim from the case remains active within the district court regarding students with disabilities and whether “special needs children are entitled to receive an education, even if they opt out of vaccinations.”

A number of prominent Connecticut lawmakers are immediately rallying behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden dropped his bid for reelection Sunday and endorsed her to take up the party’s mantle at a politically tumultuous time. 

Some of the biggest powerbrokers in Connecticut followed Biden’s cue that his second-in-command has his “full support and endorsement” to become the new nominee. But some notable lawmakers are not going as far to make any endorsement in the immediate aftermath, though they are not opposed to her and see Harris as the front-runner heading into the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. 

Biden’s exit from the presidential race on Sunday afternoon capped a dramatic three weeks since his poor debate performance called into question his fitness for office. He tried to resist calls for him to drop out but lost critical support as Republicans united around Donald Trump last week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

The president’s statement was met with widespread support and praise for his agenda and work over the past three and a half years.

“President Biden has served our country with distinction for decades. We thank him profoundly for his service and leadership through some of the most difficult years of our lifetimes,” Connecticut Democratic Party chairwoman Nancy DiNardo said.

“We urge every Democrat to follow his lead. Our country is facing a threat like no other from the MAGA ticket,” she added. “The time is now to unite behind Vice President Harris and defeat Donald Trump. As the president said, let’s do this.”

The Republicans love touting that COVID shutoff moratoriums are causing your bill to go up. Yes, the moratorium shutoffs lasted a long time, and yes, they are contributing to the cost. About 20% of the increase, to be precise.

So why are Republicans claiming 20% of the increase and ignoring the other 80%? Well, there's a good reason, and it's called the Millstone agreement. For those unaware, Millstone Power Plant is in Waterford, and it's one of the only nuclear power facilities in New England. It generates as much as 37% of our state's power using nuclear - which, I'll add, is a good thing, as it's a zero-carbon, low-emission way to generate energy.

However, from 2017 to 2019, Dominion Energy, the owner of Millstone, engaged in a game of chicken with state legislators. They wanted the state to enter an agreement guaranteeing continued power purchases from Millstone for a decade to come, with vague threats of closing the plant otherwise. This led to the Millstone agreement ( [https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0203.pdf](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0203.pdf) )

A majority of energy generated in Connecticut comes from natural gas, and back in 2017, it was significantly cheaper than nuclear. That's why Dominion was so concerned about getting cornered out of the market, and why they pushed the legislature to take action.

Former State Senator Paul Formica, a Republican out of Old Lyme whose district included the power plant, led the charge for the state to approve the Millstone agreement. The bill was Republican-led and received a split vote in 2017, with more Republicans than Democrats voting in approval. That agreement requires Eversource and UI to purchase a certain amount of the energy generated by Millstone each year. It passed in 2017 and was enacted in 2019, and will continue through 2029. (You can see the vote totals for the Senate here [https://cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/s/2017SV-00465-R00SB01501-SV.htm](https://cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/s/2017SV-00465-R00SB01501-SV.htm) and the House here [https://cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/h/2017HV-00416-R00SB01501-HV.htm](https://cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/h/2017HV-00416-R00SB01501-HV.htm) ) Here's a story from 2017 from the Mirror: [https://ctmirror.org/2017/10/26/millstone-bill-passes-house-goes-to-governor/](https://ctmirror.org/2017/10/26/millstone-bill-passes-house-goes-to-governor/) - """"A majority of Democrats opposed the bill; A majority of Republicans supported it.""""

Fast forward to this year, and the utilities are pointing fingers at the legislature. This piece from CT Mirror lays out the hard numbers - [https://www.wshu.org/connecticut-news/2024-02-16/eversource-utilities-rate-hike-pura](https://www.wshu.org/connecticut-news/2024-02-16/eversource-utilities-rate-hike-pura) - """"Eversource said the Millstone credit authorized by the General Assembly in 2017 caused $605 million of the $784 million in unrecovered costs; another $160 million is blamed on mandated benefits for the poor and medical hardship cases.""""

$605 million out of $784 million is 77.168%, and when two members of PURA's leadership board outvoted PURA's commissioner earlier this year to approve the increase at hand - she tried to get the increases spread out over a longer period of time to prevent sticker shock - we end up where we are now.

As stated above, we use a lot of natural gas here, and in the last five years, the Millstone agreement has kept the nuclear plant open and active, preserving a few thousand jobs on the coast and supporting clean energy generation. It's been beneficial in a few limited time periods when nat gas spiked in cost, as we've got issues with transmission from Europe and other parts of the country that cause cost constraints, but generally, it's costing, on average, $120 million a year.

So why are the Powers That Be downplaying the $120m per year total while blaming everything on the $160m of costs accrued over four years, the argument that's been getting to the news and is all over social media? Well, I can personally confirm Eversource has been building a PR army, given they hired Governor Lamont's former communications director (and they tried to hire me, personally, from my current job where I've learned enough about CT energy policy to write this post). They don't like PURA's chair, who is more seriously regulating them for the first time since state deregulation, and they want to get her fired - and they're willing to pressure the people of Connecticut to get that.

The CT GOP has helped them out the whole way. We've got Republicans in leadership positions on the Energy & Technology Committee (Rep. Buckbee) voting against tougher regulations against Eversource and UI. The state Republicans think this is an issue they can blame on poor people and get people frothing at the mouth over Democrats giving handouts (with the alternative being tens of thousands of households losing power at the height of the pandemic). If you pay attention, you'll learn that simply voting for the other party isn't going to help - in fact, it'll give them the same power they used to get the Millstone agreement passed.

Eversource and the CT GOP want you to blame this on Democrats because Democrats are in power in Hartford. They can only do this if you don't know the CT GOP played a leading role in 77% of your bill going up due to a bill they passed seven years ago. Don't let them get away with it. This is bigger than party - it's about the whole process.","I've see a lot of misdirection and outright bullshit come from our elect official. The republican love tout that COVID shutoff moratorium be cause your bill to go up. Yes, the moratorium shutoffs last a long time, and yes, they be contribute to the cost. About 20 % of the increase, to be precise. So why be republican claim 20 % of the increase and ignore the other 80 %? good, there's a good reason, and it's call the Millstone agreement. For that unaware, Millstone Power Plant be in Waterford, and it's one of the only nuclear power facility in New England. It generate as much as 37 % of our state's power use nuclear - which, I'll add, be a good thing, as it's a zero - carbon, low - emission way to generate energy. However, from 2017 to 2019, Dominion Energy, the owner of Millstone, engage in a game of chicken with state legislator. They want the state to enter a agreement guarantee continue power purchase from Millstone for a decade to come, with vague threat of close the plant otherwise. This lead to the Millstone agreement ( [ https: / / www. cga. ct. gov / 2020 / rpt / pdf / 2020 - R - 0203. pdf ] ( https: / / www. cga. ct. gov / 2020 / rpt / pdf / 2020 - R - 0203. pdf ) ) A majority of energy generate in Connecticut come from natural gas, and back in 2017, it be significantly cheap than nuclear. That's why Dominion be so concern about get corner out of the market, and why they push the legislature to take action. Former State Senator Paul Formica, a Republican out of Old Lyme whose district include the power plant, lead the charge for the state to approve the Millstone agreement. The bill be Republican - lead and receive a split vote in 2017, with much republican than democrat vote in approval. That agreement require Eversource and UI to purchase a certain amount of the energy generate by Millstone each year. It pass in 2017 and be enact in 2019, and will continue through 2029.

One of the most stupidly frustrating things to me is how much credit NYC gets for their deli breakfast sandwiches, when they’re generally mediocre at best.

New York BECs: Scrambled low quality eggs, yellow American cheese (a tangier flavor compared to white and generally works better for burgers and chopped cheeses), low quality bacon that’s often under or overcooked (and may be turkey or beef bacon without warning), stale or low quality rolls (or bagels, which in my opinion get in the way of what makes these sandwiches good), cooked with haste and no love. Even if it’s cooked right it’s still just meh in too many cases. I’ve never found a place here that I can truly rely on to be awesome every time, and never have I found a spot I would prefer over the all the places local to me when I stay in CT.

CT BECs: Good quality fried eggs, white American cheese (so much tastier and even has a bit of sweetness to it), consistent perfectly cooked good quality bacon that’s always from a pig, fresh soft rolls, cooked with love.

Like I said, I’m from Fairfield, but I’ve never had a mediocre one anywhere I’ve gone there, and I get them many times throughout the year.

The Country Cow, The Tasty Yolk, Pine Creek Deli, Firehouse Deli, Reef Shack, the now closed S&S Dugout, Gruel Britannia, Harborview Market, and more I may not know about yet. All offer great ones that always taste the same every time, and some have some really signature aspects to their sandwiches. The Tasty Yolk’s roll is mind blowingly good and unique. Pine Creek Deli has “The Shredder” which is filling af but crazy good. Gruel Britannia offers their British spin on breakfast sandwiches but you can still get a traditional one. Each place just seems to understand what makes a good one truly good. Btw, please feel free to recommend other great spots in the area if you know em.

I hate that in NYC I’ve only found especially good ones at places where you have to sit down and tip a waiter. I think it also just makes me sad that people in the city think they’re eating something so good and special, when really they just don’t know what they’re missing. People in NYC can be seriously arrogant about this topic too.

Does anyone else feel this way or is it just me? I’ve never had anyone provide a successful argument for why NYC should be considered the best. They just have a high quantity of places that make them, and I think a lot of people who grew up here are simply nostalgic for the deli BEC because they’ve known nothing else.

Tldr: CT breakfast sandwiches are an orgasm of flavor, while NYC’s are like paying for an unenthusiastic handjob in a car.","I grow up in Fairfield and have live in NYC my whole adult life, about 18 year.

Hi, we're looking for nominees for the best wings in Delaware for an upcoming project in The News Journal/Delaware Online.  


So we figured we'd ask the wing lovers here: What's your favorite place to get wings in Delaware?  


No need to limit yourself to classic Buffalo-style hot, though we figure this will take up a lot of the votes. Vietnamese fish sauce wings, Korean soy-garlic, breaded, baked and new and innovative creations all welcome. (The ones pictured here are from Kid Shelleen's.)

I make $20 an hour. I work from 9am to 6pm. I work 5 days a week. That comes out to around $3000-3100 a month. If I'm looking for an apartment that requires me to make 1/3rd of my paycheck monthly, I'm looking at places where rent is no higher than $1050. And where are those apartments at? I look at Zillow every once in a while, and apartments that are listed for $950 get around 40 responses and several applications within the first few days. I know everyone is desperate for affordable housing when minimum wage wouldn't even get you townhouse.

So what gives. Is it a Delaware thing? Am I too young to understand? Is it even affordable to live on $20 an hour in any part of the country? Because it seems like a problem here and it blows. I shouldn't have to live with a stranger (or ruin a current friendship) to be able to live. I don't want to be grafted to someone forever. I feel incredibly fortunate for making this wage but it's not even live-able unless I bust my ass to make OT or get a second job. I can't imagine going to school or even having a family while being on $20 an hour. This is insane. $15 minimum wage is abysmal, you could probably only afford living out of a car. End of rant.

edit: no I'm not done.

I don't want to leave Delaware but what choice do I have other than living with my parents until they die, or getting the fuck out of here?

edit 2: a lot of you are missing the point with the roommate thing. I'm glad some of you were cool with it. I'd rather have some autonomy. living with 5 people in the house rn isn't fun.

I make $20 a hour. I work from 9am to 6pm. I work 5 day a week. That come out to around $3000 - 3100 a month. If I'm look for a apartment that require me to make 1 / 3rd of my paycheck monthly, I'm look at place where rend be no high than $1050. And where be that apartment at? I look at Zillow every once in a while, and apartment that be list for $950 get around 40 response and several application within the first few day.

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can’t evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 – October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it’s often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads – as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 – October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power – because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Our Administration continues to reiterate that conspiracy theories and misinformation are harmful to those who most need the help.

They said if you get caught doing that the police can confiscate your phone. 

That being said....

Short line to check in, had ID, cat license and dog license and their vaccination records. Filled out the emergency contact information form and all of that good stuff.

Got an Uber ride since my car is safe in covered parking garage.

Since I like to do primitive tent camping (no electricity hookups) I basically brought all of my camping gear except for the tent lol. Food water for me and the critters, flashlights radios battery banks etc. a sleeping bag a pillow and an air mattress. Of course change of clothes, I didn't bring my entire condo but you know those great big military roll out bags. 

Some people drove there and brought suitcases of stuff, almost an entire house for two people.... You don't need to bring your entire house with you.

I brought medication and copies of prescriptions and have all of my important documents and medicines in waterproof containers.

They have some cots for disabled and elderly people.

The problem is the transplants...

Some came with absolutely nothing and are basically complaining about everything expecting a high school gym to be like the Hyatt Regency or the Marriott, complaining that they are watching local news and they want to watch Fox News. 

If you can't evacuate, counties are running school buses and city buses and using Uber and Lyft to get people to and from shelters after the storm for free. 

It's not going to be the Holiday Inn but depending where you live it will be safer than your home even with babies crying and sleeping on a floor. 

And if you were going to go to a shelter, they are non-smoking we had people complain that they can't smoke cigarettes there and no you can't bring booze either. 

Treat it as a civil emergency and not a vacation, it's not the Holiday Inn, it's a high school gym.

It is literally just background noise or another notification for me that I swipe up and ignore. My community got hit by multiple tornadoes on Wednesday at 5PM. One of which formed behind my house and went straight down my road and demolished everything. I am sure you have seen the photos and videos all over the news. My family and I were not prepared at all. We did not have a plan or a safe space. My birds were still in their cage next to our huge sliding windows. Our house had no shutters because we were not even in the path of the hurricane. A majority of my neighbors did not have shutters either. I saw the sky turn black and I figured the storm was about to come and we were gonna lose power. It was not until we heard this loud roar outside and all the trees were starting to bend from the wind and windows were shaking that I grabbed my birds as fast as I could to hide. Our pool screen was ripping apart and trees were being ripped from the ground. My family was just in shock and could not move they were just staring out the window in fear. By the time some of us hid it moved down my street and demolished all the houses down there. Everything happened so fast. We were definitely a prime example of what NOT to do during a tornado. We got the warnings on our phone a few minutes prior but I do not remember bc I ignored it. We were lucky in that the damage to our place was not as severe as our neighbors who were just a house away. Cars and dumpsters ended up in their houses. Pieces of trailers ended up in the middle of the street.  I know this could have been way worse for us but this has definitely taught me a lesson and I am thankful we still have our lives today. Praying for all those affected by this storm...

TLDR: Tornado formed behind my house in South Florida and destroyed my community. My family and I were not prepared. Please make a plan and take tornado warnings seriously.

EDIT: Update from the news, tornado was an EF3, path length 21 miles long width was 300 yards wide. Not sure if this is normal for a tornado but for those who know more about tornadoes I am interested in hearing your thoughts. Also- I am glad this post is getting so much attention. I hope to at least reach those of you who were like me and become numb to watches/warnings and learn from this.

**Here’s what the New York billionaire thinks of Georgia in his own words:**

>**RAFENSBERGER'S STAFF:** We’ve been going through each of those \[ballots alleged to be cast by non-Georgian residents\] as well and those numbers that we got that Ms. Mitchell was just saying, they’re not accurate. *Every one we’ve been through, are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately.* And in many cases–

>**TRUMP:** How many people do that? ***They moved out and then they said, “Ah, to hell with it I’ll move back.”*** You know, it doesn’t sound like a very normal … ***you mean, they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? It’s crazy.***

**Here’s what he thinks of the GBI and our Justice System:**

>""""They’re either ***dishonest*** ***or*** ***incompetent***.""""

**Here’s what he thinks of our Secretary of State and our Justice System:**

>**RAFENSBERGER'S:** Mr. President, you have people that submit information and we have our people that submit information. And then it comes before the court and the court then has to make a determination. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right.

>**TRUMP:** Why do you say that? I don’t know. I mean, **s*****ure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say that?*** \[...\] Why wouldn’t you want to say, hey, if in fact, President Trump is right about that, then he wins the state of Georgia, just that one incident alone without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. You just say, *you stick by*, I mean ***I’ve been watching you, you know, you don’t care about anything***.“Your numbers are right.” But your numbers aren’t right. They’re really wrong and they’re really wrong, Brad. And I know this phone call is going nowhere other than, other than ultimately, you know — ***Look ultimately, I win, okay?***

**Here’s what he thinks of our Governor:**

For the Georgians that forgot or just didn’t know, Trump despises you and despises Georgia. He thinks this place is so beneath him that he can’t even imagine someone wanting to live here. He looks down on our cities and your state government. He sneers at our law enforcement and justice system. He does not want your vote to be counted if you cast a ballot for anyone but him.

Due to the strength and speed of the storm movement anything to the east of the storm center in n central georgia is likely to see multiple hours of 70+ mph gusts. As the storm accelerates around the axis of a secondary low pressure situated in Alabama the forward speed of the storm will be added to maximum winds experienced on the east side of the storm. The NAM model is currently showing gusts approaching 100 mph at 10 meters in the ATL metroplex at 5am friday. 

Both the rain and wind maximum could change prior to the event but if the modeled situation occurs it would likely result in one of the most prolonged power and water outages to impact a metro area in recent history. With tree density, preceding soil saturation and power and internet lines being almost fully above ground it could be several weeks until power, water and internet are fully restored.

Hoping the models are wrong or will shift the worst impacts elsewhere, but as of now this is what you should prepare for.


--UPDATE--

My post was referencing the NAM model as of yesterday evening and was the only publicly available model I could find that had estimated gusts versus estimated sustained winds which I feel is more relevant to treefall.

Storm strength at landfall, the orientation of the secondary low pressure to the west and direct storm path in relation to the east/strong side of the system will all be extremely important to the ultimate wind impact.

It seems as if all 3 factors have been reduced in magnitude since yesterday's model suites, which is good news. However, it is possible that things shift again to a worse scenario so please continue to monitor the situation.","Current forecast show 6-10 inch of rain prior to the wind impact.

>**Vice President Harris and Governor Walz to Campaign Together in Battleground Georgia for First Time**

>*Bus Tour Next Week in South Georgia to Rally Voters on Heels of Energetic Convention*

>Building off of the momentum of a highly successful convention in Chicago, Vice President Harris and Governor Walz will kick off a bus tour in Georgia on Wednesday. This is the first time the Vice President and Governor Walz will campaign together in Georgia. The swing through south Georgia will culminate in a rally in the Savannah area with Vice President Harris on Thursday evening. Governor Walz will depart the state prior to the rally.

>On the bus tour, the Vice President and Governor Walz will meet directly with voters in their communities, much like their western Pennsylvania bus tour which included stops at a local campaign field office and a high school football practice. In Thursday night’s rally, the Vice President will lay out the stark choice facing voters in this election between Donald Trump’s dark and dangerous Project 2025 agenda and Vice President Harris’ optimistic and patriotic vision for a new way forward. The rally will also help to build the campaign’s volunteer efforts. In the last month, Vice President Harris’ rallies have helped generate thousands of volunteer sign ups across the battlegrounds.

>Team Harris-Walz is running the largest in-state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever in Georgia, with more than 170 Democratic campaign staffers in 24 coordinated campaign offices across the state. Savannah is an economic hub in Georgia and is home to critical investments from the Biden-Harris administration, including historic clean energy job creation from the Inflation Reduction Act. Campaigning in this part of the Peach State is critical as it represents a diverse coalition of voters, including rural, suburban, and urban Georgians – with a large proportion of Black voters and working class families.

>This campaign swing comes after the Harris-Walz campaign released a [new TV ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5q6oRH-R1A), airing across media markets in 8 states including Georgia, focusing on the Vice President’s economic vision and belief in building up the middle class, lowering costs, and creating an opportunity economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead.

Sure, here’s an itinerary designed to be as frustrating and annoying as possible for a day in Atlanta:

### 7:00 AM: **Morning Commute**
- Start your day by heading out during rush hour. Drive on I-285, Atlanta's Perimeter Highway, known for its heavy traffic and frequent accidents. Aim for a section where there’s construction, such as near the I-85 interchange.

### 8:30 AM: **Breakfast at a Crowded Fast Food Chain**
- Stop by a popular fast-food chain near a busy intersection, like the Chick-fil-A on Northside Drive. Order during the peak breakfast rush and wait in a long drive-thru line. Consider ordering something complicated or with substitutions.

### 9:30 AM: **Visit the DMV**
- Visit the DMV on a day without an appointment. Pick the busiest location, such as the one on Pryor Street. Ensure you have incomplete or incorrect paperwork to maximize waiting time and frustration.

### 11:00 AM: **Mid-Morning Trip to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport**
- Head to the airport to pick up a friend who’s arriving late. Circle the terminal a few times because they didn’t provide you with the correct gate information. Then, wait for an extended period due to delayed baggage claim.

### 12:30 PM: **Lunch at an Overhyped Restaurant**
- Head to Ponce City Market, but instead of going to a renowned spot, pick a trendy, overpriced restaurant with mediocre reviews. Wait in a long line only to be seated at a cramped table next to a noisy group.

### 2:00 PM: **Afternoon at an Art Museum During a School Field Trip**
- Visit the High Museum of Art right as multiple school groups arrive. Endure loud, chaotic children as you try to enjoy the exhibits. To add to the annoyance, go on a day when the museum has a limited exhibit.

### 3:30 PM: **Coffee at a Slow Café**
- Stop by a hipster coffee shop like Octane, where the barista takes a painfully long time to make your order. There might also be no seating available, so you’ll end up standing awkwardly with your drink.

### 4:00 PM: **Ride MARTA During Peak Hours**
- Take a ride on MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) during peak hours, possibly around 4:00 PM. Choose a route that’s known for being crowded and slow, such as the Red Line towards North Springs. If possible, find a car with a broken air conditioner.

### 5:30 PM: **Unnecessary Trip to Lenox Square**
- Visit Lenox Square Mall during rush hour. Endure the crowded parking lots, aggressive drivers, and busy stores. Just browse, but don’t buy anything, and waste time looking for items that are out of stock.

### 7:00 PM: **Dinner at a Noisy, Overbooked Restaurant**
- Try to get a last-minute reservation at a noisy, overrated restaurant in Midtown, like The Varsity, and wait for a table. End up seated near the kitchen or restrooms, where it’s loud and constantly busy.

### 9:00 PM: **Attend a Sports Event with No Parking**
- Attend an Atlanta Hawks game at State Farm Arena, but leave late and struggle to find parking. Park far away, and then deal with the post-game traffic and crowds when leaving.

### 11:00 PM: **Late-Night Traffic Jam**
- Wrap up your day by trying to head home via I-75 during a random construction-related traffic jam. Expect to sit in traffic for an extended period, possibly due to lane closures or an accident.

I came to Atlanta in July of 2023, fresh from college and trying to escape a small town that, to put it lightly, sucked. I thought that life in a new city that was still close to home would’ve been great but almost a year later, the experience has been pretty dismal.

For starters, riding MARTA has been a mess with its whole host of problems(the hours are crazy, the amount of people that have hassled me and once even tried to start an altercation with me just to get through the gates,etc.) but driving has proven to be just as crazy if not worst. Quick side note: the longer I’ve been in Atlanta, the more I wish I could be in a walkable city instead! Not only is the traffic insane but I got into a minor accident on Ponce, couldn’t find anywhere to pull over right away, and in addition to getting a ticket had to deal with a belligerent driver who tried to accuse me of a hit and run and is now pushing a bullshit injury claim as well as a cop with attitude(who arrived two hours after the fact).

Which is another thing! The ATL cops(& security officers) that I’ve encountered are always so quick to catch an attitude with everyone, always giving off the air of not wanting to actually do their jobs. It’s like all the compassion and humanity left them a long time ago.

Then there’s the people. This one has really hurt me: growing up as a young black man in a predominantly white area I thought moving to a city with so many members of my community would be great but it hasn’t been. So many people I’ve met here are either insanely apathetic or just quick to anger. I’ve struggled to feel any sort of sense of community with the other black people here, it’s a very dog-eat-dog type of city and no one really has any kindness to spare.

Now, that being said, I didn’t fully do my research into the ins and outs of ATL. I just knew that it would be a good place for the profession I’m currently trying to make a career in. However, having lived here now for a time, I don’t want to choose my career over my happiness. I want to live someplace that will feel like home, that I can build a community with others.

Atlanta just hasn’t felt like that and honestly I may give it a few more months but this isn’t a place I’d call home.

This was by no means an eloquently worded post but I hope I got my point across well enough. If anyone else out there is feeling this way, please let me know

EDIT:  I didn't think this post was going to reach as many folks as it did but hey, I've been wrong before. There's no other way to spin it, this post is just one long, long rant that came at a tumultuous point during a not-so-great year. I was feeling some type of way and this is the result of all that. I'm from a small town in South Carolina and this last year has been a rollercoaster. From a physical altercation with another guy at a Marta station to the aforementioned accident as well as a bunch of other stuff, it's been quite the adjustment and a ton of that adjusting has left me pretty damn bitter at this moment in time. What I didn't convey properly when I first posted this is that efforts have been made to improve my situation here: I've got a great job and have made friends with a lot of my co-workers, I've gone out to different bars across the city. I've met some great people here and I can't say that each and every single experience has been a bad one. It still doesn't feel like home yet and I don't even know if I'm going to stay here for the next few months or another year, but I'll take my time and decide. To those who have offered solutions to help me better navigate life in Atlanta as well as those who have taken the time to reach out and commiserate with me, thank you, I really appreciate you guys. To the ones saying to toughen up or get some thick skin, I'm sure you meant that as some sort of helpful advice but that just wasn't it.

- don't call 911 for loss of power. Call your power provider and be patient.

Unfortunately, this corrupt group is not elected, so unlikely to respond to voters. And their next meeting, on July 30, is a Zoom meeting, allowing them to mute or expel dissenting views with the click of a button.

However, this corrupt board IS appointed by an elected official -- Governor Kemp. He is term-limited from running for governor again. HOWEVER...he has his eyes on a larger prize -- a senate seat or the presidency.

Those of us who are independent voters should write to Kemp immediately and tell him to get his good ol' boys in line if he wants to see any independent votes for his more ambitious runs. 

Because if this election board throws our election for Trump via shenanigans, I will personally make it my mission to make sure Brian Kemp is no longer elected for any political office anywhere, and will do my best to disrupt any attempts he has at corporate or university positions as well.

One person CAN make a difference. Write to Kemp today.

So I printed my letter out and dropped it into the mailbox. That said, there IS a phone number on the Constituent Services page, so you can express your views that way.]

Governor Kemp:

It has come to my attention that many of the members of the State Board of Elections that you've appointed held an illegal meeting on July 12. During this meeting, which did not include the board member who represents the largest number of Georgians, these corrupt officials implemented new rules that will enable them to decline to certify votes for virtually no reason at all.

The illegal actions of these board members are a stain on your record as governor of Georgia. While I understand that you are term-limited and can no longer run for president, it is widely assumed that you plan to run for president or senator. As an independent voter, I highly recommend that you rein in these corrupt individuals. You are putting at risk the votes of independent voters like myself if you allow them to act with impunity in this election that is so critical to our nation's future.

Most sincerely yours,

This foolish individual had his say in a story critical of Puna's first responders published on the San Francisco Gate website, so now it’s my turn to respond: 

For ten years I lived in an oceanfront house seen in the close distance in the SFGate photo. This is Paradise Ala Kai Drive. This isolated location is 7 miles from the nearest store or services of any kind. It is pitch black at night with deadly voids in the disintegrating cliffs and tripping hazards literally everywhere. NEVER in 10 years did I venture out at night anywhere near the edge of these cliffs, nor even would my dogs do so, for only a stumbling drunk, someone high on drugs, or a complete idiot would risk it. What these people were up to under such deadly circumstances in this area AT NIGHT is beyond comprehension, but I can tell you it was no good. That they expected our brave firemen to scale down a crumbling slippery 25-foot cliff where at the bottom 10-foot waves await to dash them against razor sharp boulders before venturing into a den of sharks is absolutely maddening. The “31 year old boyfriend” is totally responsible for himself and for what happened to his companion. How dare he denigrate Hawaii’s brave first responders. Apparently he himself didn’t enter the water in any attempt to rescue her but fully expects others to put their lives on the line for these two arrogant entitled careless individuals. In the years I lived right at this very spot, many a tourist, local opihi picker, limu harvester, lobster diver and fisherman have died with first responders placing their own lives on the line every time to try and save such fool adventurists.

The “31 year old man” spouting uncalled for and unmerited critical utterances should be held responsible for his companion’s sorry end. https://www.sfgate.com/hawaii/article/hawaii-drowning-victim-boyfriend-responders-18682495.php

We've been weekly regulars at this Curry House for years. While the service has been rude the past year, today the workers were upset at us and shouted at us, demanding for us to tip them more than we already do.

When we entered they didn't let us sit down and we were being glared at for some reason. Then after we were seated, they didn't serve us for probably 25 minutes before coming to get our order even though only one other table was busy. Our food took a long time to come too, but that wasn't even the worst part. When we went to pay at the cashier, she started to angrily shout at us. She asked why we're regulars here if we don't tip, even though we do tip. She demanded for us to give tips because we regularly eat here. It made me extremely uncomfortable to get yelled at by a worker accusing us of not tipping when we've always left a tip whenever we paid every week. We've left our tip with the cashier herself but don't know if she even puts the tip into the tip box. Somehow all the workers there were convinced that we don't tip so they were all angry at us. I recall the cashier having green eyes, glasses, and orangey-brown hair.

It's extremely disappointing to be treated so horribly when we're polite regulars who just enjoy the food. The food has always been good enough for us to give the bad service a pass, but the food isn't good enough to justify eating at this place. We've always heard this Curry House has a reputation for extremely rude workers and never experienced any horror stories ourselves until today. They've just lost several loyal customers and we warned people not to go to this place. There are plenty of other good Japanese curry places that are nearby.

We even left an extra $20 on top of the regular tip after being shouted at to tip more if that makes a difference. Hopefully other customers aren't being harassed like we were.

I left a Yelp review for this place but not sure if that will go anywhere. We happen to be mutual friends with the owner of Curry House though so he'll be hearing about this and maybe things will change.

Has anyone else had this happen to them at this Curry House?

EDIT:

For clarity, the way service at this place works differently from a restaurant because it's half self-serve. The waiter gives you water which you self-serve from a pitcher on the table, takes your order, and brings out your food. They don't check up on you or do anything else. You also have to get up to pay at the cashier by listing everything you ordered to the cashier. My friend who pays for the meal considers this to be half self-service compared to a regular restaurant, where the waiter is responsible for checking up on you and pouring water and making sure you're done with your meal. He leaves a 10% tip on average only to this place due to the self-service aspect because it would be insulting to waiters at non self-service restaurants to tip 15%+ due to doing way less work compared to them.

We eat as a party of 3 but most of the time it's only been 2 of us that go every single week. There used to be very nice and polite workers here and we tipped them more because the service was great from them. Ever since those workers were replaced, we were treated rudely and the service quality dropped a lot.

We only go on ONE specific day of the week at lunch time, so we are used to being serviced by the same workers. There are probably very good workers on other days of the week. If I ate at this exact Curry House, I'd still tip because I want people to make a living regardless of the service.

For extra clarity, it's only this specific Curry House location that I've had bad service at. The other Curry Houses are known to have amazing service from what I've been told. I'll still eat at those locations happily because I still enjoy Curry House.

EDIT 2:

I mentioned this in some comments but the cashier thought out her complaint to us. She was extremely thorough in explaining all the issues she had with us so I think if she had more issues with us she would've told us while she was venting. Her main point was that because we're regulars, she expects us to tip way more than what we do because it shows our gratefulness to the establishment. We actually used to do this at Curry House back when the service was amazing and the servers always did things like check up on you. Ever since the service declined in the past year we stopped giving a higher tip than average due to the rudeness of the workers. Personally my friends would tell me not to eat inside the Curry House McCully due to the workers having a reputation for being rude and to only do takeout, but we never seemed to have issues other than rudeness. We're not bothered by rudeness and just enjoyed the quick service and quick food. Never would've complained about this or any restaurant due to minor inconveniences. I only felt compelled to complain since the cashier was demanding even more money from us and the server was purposefully treating us even worse yesterday.

I personally don't enjoy leaving negative reviews or giving critiques because I'm very low maintenance when it comes to food and service, but being demanded to tip more based on the fact that we're regulars is shocking. I've never had an experience at a restaurant that made me want to complain about it but I was compelled to this time because the same thing might happen to other people. At the time I didn't consider that us leaving an extra $20 would encourage them to bully customers for money in the future but now I'm aware of it. I personally used to work in food service and only ever saw a tip as a bonus, never as something I would demand someone for. I personally only wanted my regulars to treat me respectfully and that was enough to keep me happy. 

EDIT:

Regardless of how much we tip, it was bizarre for the cashier to claim we didn't tip at all. I invited a friend I've only known for a week, and she was right next to my friend who was paying. She told me she clearly saw him take out his payment for the food and extra cash, which he handed over to the cashier. My friend who paid said he's always left his extra cash with the cashier, because he figured that when you tell people to keep the change, that it's tipping. It's entirely possible that this cashier misunderstood him and didn't realize she was being tipped in the first place. We never saw her put the tip into the tip jar either. I've worked years in food service before, and I've always understood that when someone tells you to keep the change, that you're being tipped. The cashier was adamant that we never tipped at all before, including today. She clearly stated that we never leave a tip. If this isn't a misunderstanding, it gives me the idea that somebody was pocketing our tips and telling the other workers that we don't ever tip. Some commenters got this vibe and I feel like it's possible based on it happening at one of my old workplaces. None of us are sure how the cashier didn't consider our extra cash tipping. Some days we've tipped higher as well even though our average is closer to 10-15% percent. At the time, we didn't think to tell the cashier that whenever we leave her the extra cash and tell her to keep the change, that it's our way of tipping her. It's entirely possible that this whole time she misunderstood us and got upset over not knowing we were tipping her the whole time.

Also, us leaving an extra $20 after being demanded rudely to tip more was a result of my friend's politeness and consideration to the cashier's issues with us. We didn't argue back at her or act rudely, we just gave her extra cash like she wanted and quietly left after spending time listening to her concerns with us. My friends who visit weekly are Japanese locals and I'm Filipino originally from the mainland, so maybe that gives you a better understanding of how polite we are. My friends are the ones who did all the talking to the workers while I sit quietly because I'm a quiet person and just share food. Our order is simply a chicken katsu with cheese, less rice. My friend orders the exact same thing, so we don't have a complicated order either.

EDIT:

Added a TLDR because a lot of comments seemed to not have read the post at all. Some comments are focused on how much we tipped but the cashier was claiming we never tipped period, not that we tipped too low. So they probably only read the title then focused on that. I probably should have written the title saying, """"Cashier claimed we never tipped while holding our tip in her hand and demanded us to give her money"""" so that it would be less confusing.","TLDR: Casher at Curry House in McCully tell us we NEVER tip ( while she be hold our tip in her hand ) and demand us to give her money. \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ \ _ We've be weekly regular at this Curry House for year. While the service have be rude the past year, today the worker be upset at us and shout at us, demand for us to tip them much than we already do. When we enter they didn't let us sit down and we be be glare at for some reason. Then after we be seat, they didn't serve us for probably 25 minute before come to get our order even though only one other table be busy. Our food take a long time to come too, but that wasn't even the bad part. When we go to pay at the cashier, she start to angrily shout at us. She ask why we're regular here if we don't tip, even though we do tip. She demand for us to give tip because we regularly eat here. It make me extremely uncomfortable to get yell at by a worker accuse us of not tip when we've always leave a tip whenever we pay every week. We've leave our tip with the cashier herself but don't know if she even put the tip into the tip box. Somehow all the worker there be convince that we don't tip so they be all angry at us. I recall the cashier have green eye, glass, and orangey - brown hair. It's extremely disappoint to be treat so horribly when we're polite regular who just enjoy the food. The food have always be good enough for us to give the bad service a pass, but the food isn't good enough to justify eat at this place. We've always hear this Curry House have a reputation for extremely rude worker and never experience any horror story ourselves until today. They've just lose several loyal customer and we warn people not to go to this place. There be plenty of other good Japanese curry place that be nearby. We even leave a extra $20 on top of the regular tip after be shout at to tip much if that make a difference. Hopefully other customer aren't be harass like we be. I leave a Yelp review for this place but not sure if that will go anywhere. We happen to be mutual friend with the owner of Curry House though so he'll be hear about this and maybe thing will change. have anyone else have this happen to them at this Curry House? EDIT: For clarity, the way service at this place work differently from a restaurant because it's half self - serve. The waiter give you water which you self - serve from a pitcher on the table, take your order, and bring out your food. They don't check up on you or do anything else. You also have to get up to pay at the cashier by list everything you order to the cashier. My friend who pay for the meal consider this to be half self - service compare to a regular restaurant, where the waiter be responsible for check up on you and pour water and make sure you're do with your meal. He leave a 10 % tip on average only to this place due to the self - service aspect because it would be insult to waiter at non self - service restaurant to tip 15 % + due to do way little work compare to them. We eat as a party of 3 but much of the time it's only be 2 of us that go every single week. There use to be very nice and polite worker here and we tip them much because the service be great from them. Ever since that worker be replace, we be treat rudely and the service quality drop a lot. We only go on ONE specific day of the week at lunch time, so we be use to be service by the same worker. There be probably very good worker on other day of the week. If I eat at this exact Curry House, I'd still tip because I want people to make a live regardless of the service. For extra clarity, it's only this specific Curry House location that I've have bad service at. The other Curry house be know to have amaze service from what I've be tell. I'll still eat at that location happily because I still enjoy Curry House. EDIT 2: I mention this in some comment but the cashier think out her complaint to us. She be extremely thorough in explain all the issue she have with us so I think if she have much issue with us she would've tell us while she be vent. Her main point be that because we're regular, she expect us to tip way much than what we do because it show our gratefulness to the establishment. We actually use to do this at Curry House back when the service be amaze and the server always do thing like check up on you. Ever since the service decline in the past year we stop give a high tip than average due to the rudeness of the worker. Personally my friend would tell me not to eat inside the Curry House McCully due to the worker have a reputation for be rude and to only do takeout, but we never seem to have issue other than rudeness. We're not bother by rudeness and just enjoy the quick service and quick food. Never would've complain about this or any restaurant due to minor inconvenience. I only feel compel to complain since the cashier be demand even much money from us and the server be purposefully treat us even bad yesterday. I personally don't enjoy leave negative review or give critique because I'm very low maintenance when it come to food and service, but be demand to tip much base on the fact that we're regular be shock. I've never have a experience at a restaurant that make me want to complain about it but I be compel to this time because the same thing may happen to other people. At the time I didn't consider that us leave a extra $20 would encourage them to bully customer for money in the future but now I'm aware of it. I personally use to work in food service and only ever see a tip as a bonus, never as something I would demand someone for. I personally only want my regular to treat me respectfully and that be enough to keep me happy. EDIT: Regardless of how much we tip, it be bizarre for the cashier to claim we didn't tip at all. I invite a friend I've only know for a week, and she be right next to my friend who be pay. She tell me she clearly see him take out his payment for the food and extra cash, which he hand over to the cashier. My friend who pay say he's always leave his extra cash with the cashier, because he figure that when you tell people to keep the change, that it's tip. It's entirely possible that this cashier misunderstand him and didn't realize she be be tip in the first place. We never see her put the tip into the tip jar either. I've work year in food service before, and I've always understand that when someone tell you to keep the change, that you're be tip. The cashier be adamant that we never tip at all before, include today. She clearly state that we never leave a tip. If this isn't a misunderstand, it give me the idea that somebody be pocket our tip and tell the other worker that we don't ever tip. Some commenters get this vibe and I feel like it's possible base on it happen at one of my old workplace. None of us be sure how the cashier didn't consider our extra cash tip. Some day we've tip high as good even though our average be close to 10 - 15 % percent. At the time, we didn't think to tell the cashier that whenever we leave her the extra cash and tell her to keep the change, that it's our way of tip her. It's entirely possible that this whole time she misunderstand us and get upset over not know we be tip her the whole time. Also, us leave a extra $20 after be demand rudely to tip much be a result of my friend's politeness and consideration to the cashier's issue with us. We didn't argue back at her or act rudely, we just give her extra cash like she want and quietly leave after spend time listen to her concern with us. My friend who visit weekly be Japanese local and I'm Filipino originally from the mainland, so maybe that give you a good understand of how polite we be. My friend be the one who do all the talk to the worker while I sit quietly because I'm a quiet person and just share food. Our order be simply a chicken katsu with cheese, little rice. My friend order the exact same thing, so we don't have a complicate order either. EDIT: add a TLDR because a lot of comment seem to not have read the post at all. Some comment be focus on how much we tip but the cashier be claim we never tip period, not that we tip too low. So they probably only read the title then focus on that. I probably should have write the title say, "" "" Cashier claim we never tip while hold our tip in her hand and demand us to give her money "" "" so that it would be little confuse.","Hawaii","workers at Curry House in McCully angrily demanded us to tip more than we already do","worker at Curry House in McCully angrily demand us to tip much than we already do","{""choices"":[""Economy and Finance"",""Culture and Recreation""]}","2024-11-16T19:00:25.579366Z","https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/1bw68k0/workers_at_curry_house_in_mccully_angrily/"

Plus, there's evidence that Hawaiians were also pretty destructive to some native species as well so it's not all like only the white man destroyed the environment. 

Isn't judging white people by their skin the same as when some white people judge others on the basis of their skin? I don't get how it's better if non-whites do it. Plus, discrimination and prejudice exists pretty much everywhere and no white people did not invent it. 

I'm not trying to point in one direction or the other, but just seems that when people talk about the history here they romanticize it and seem to think everything was so swell beforehand when there are so many things that I'm sure many Hawaiians today wouldn't put up with even under Hawaiian rule. Not to mention how much corruption I hear about in Hawaiian run projects and organizations. Again, it's not a race thing because corrupt people come from all races. I find that this approach of romanticizing history and blaming everything on the white people seems to perpetuate judging others on race as opposed to actual values, attitudes, behaviors, or policies.  

I believe racism is taught. As a kid I never thought about race and was friends with everyone. It wasn't until adults pointed out differences or made comments about things that I started to pay attention to it.

They lined us up maybe around 4:30pm? I wasn't there yet but showed up at 5pm to see 2 long lines for different times. They let us in at 5pm to go through a detector & then we waited another hour to enter in the parking lot with little to no air flow, they handed out water at one point but do bring your own water or something to entertain yourself with. 

We finally went in ❤️ I almost cried multiple times as this was a dream come true! Alot of exclusive items had sold out for the day by that time (of course) but I kept seeing it from the behavior of people who may or may not be scalpers... 👀 

I was told there is a set daily limit of items they are allowed to stock for the day & to come back another day... okayyy what if I only managed to get the one time? Make friends or see if another time opens is what was advised.... 

So my ask is, those of you going early in the morning only take what you need, have aloha and not greed, it's great some ppl got a second entry no shame, I saw alot of second time comers today alone, no shame great planning but alot of others may not have that opportunity 😉

Yesterday... yet again... I watched another fight at Queens where a tourist got a busted face on their vacation. And to be honest, it wasn't the tourists fault, it wasn't the guy who hit him fault, ***it was the company that rented him a board's fault***...

They rent 9-10ft **hard** boards out to people who have zero experience surfing, have never watched a surfing etiquette video, nor do they even understand the basics of surfing and then they point to the ocean and say """"go have fun"""".

But what's happening is, these tourists go and sit in the middle of the break, where the waves are breaking, and when the wave comes, their 9-10ft hard boards go flying in all sorts of directions. I've seen 4-5 people at once get hit by the same board. I've seen bloodied faces, bloodied heads, broken boards, broken leg, and I've even seen people come up with somebody elses leash wrapped around their neck...  

***A 9ft board with a 9ft leash, is an 18ft projectile being pushed by a 20mph wave.***

So... yesterday, a wave comes in, the tourist on the rental board loses his board, board flies 15 feet back and hits a local guy in his head. Luckily the guy duck dived a little which probably saved him from a cracked skull because the water absorbed it a little, but he still got hit... Yelling occurs, then tourist guy gets punched in the face 4-5 times. And boom, his Hawaiian vacation is ruined. 

& This happens all of the time. Locals getting their boards broke, their legs broke, heads cracked, etc., all because of rental boards and in my opinion ***the company that rented him a board is at fault*** for not sending them to Canoes which is the spot *right of the of Duke Kahanamoku Statue.* 

It honestly saddens me seeing peoples vacation getting ruined because nobody warned them. Because nobody said """"*Hey watch this 5 minute video of surf etiquette*"""" or """"*hey, go to the right of Duke Statue, not left*"""". It also saddens me that people are getting into fights in the water because despite all of the bs in surfing; surfing is about fun. [Duke's passion was to share Aloha](https://www.google.com/search?q=waterman+movie&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS1117US1117&oq=waterman+movie&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDwgAEAAYQxjjAhiABBiKBTIPCAAQABhDGOMCGIAEGIoFMgwIARAuGEMYgAQYigUyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyCggHEC4YgAQY5QQyBwgIEAAYgAQyBwgJEAAYgATSAQgyNDE3ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and he loved surfing so much that he shared that with the world. 

**In my opinion these rental board companies:**

* Make people watch a 5 minute video of surf etiquette.
* Stop sending tourists to certain breaks, especially Queens.

Now... Locals not sharing waves with other locals; those few assholes that take a wave, paddle back out and take another wave without sharing; that's not the Aloha way, and if you're one of those people, then you don't represent Duke's vision or Aloha at all & TBH, if you paddle out and you have asshole face the entire time; bro, just go find another hobby... Surfing is the epitome of Aloha where you share your love, the love that Duke Kahanamoku gifted the world, with other people who love it or want to experience it.

But man... Stop renting boards out without at least showing people a warning video.

I just went to a 1st birthday in Waimanalo, deep in homestead territory. I wasn't even a guest but a hired hand for the entertainment. Everyone was generous, happy, and helpful.

Arnold Laanui Jr., an attorney, Damien alum and former special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, filed the whistleblower lawsuit Friday in Oahu Circuit Court.

Laanui was hired July 1, 2022, on a three-year contract, and said that during his tenure he “witnessed several suspected violations of law which he reported to the Damien Board and the Christian Brothers, including but not limited to: group sex on campus involving a minor; fraud; violations of Title IX and Interscholastic League of Honolulu recruiting rules; and embezzlement,” the complaint alleges.

The complaint targets The Congregation of Christian Brothers of Hawaii Inc., doing business as Damien Memorial School, for “wrongfully terminating his employment in retaliation for complaining about violations of law.”

On Monday, Stephen Guzman, Damien Memorial School’s director of communications and marketing, declined comment on Laanui’s allegations.

Laanui, who also holds an education doctorate from the University of Southern California, retired from the FBI in 2019 after 25 years with the U.S. Department of Justice. He is a member of Damien’s class of 1986.

He took a series of jobs with the state Department of Education before Damien asked him whether he would be interested in leading his alma mater.

Laanui told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser in an interview that shortly after he became school president, he asked for a profit-and-loss statement and other basic financial metrics.

“The very first hint that something was awry was maybe after my first month there. I was asking for P&L statements … real basic business acid test, just to see where we were at. And I couldn’t get it,” said Laanui, noting the last audit of the school’s finances had been done in 2019.

Laanui said as president he tried to clean up what he called a culture of corruption, hiring an auditor and performing internal reviews, until he was let go in February.

Damien was founded in part on the premise that it would help poor kids get an education.

“I’m well accustomed to standing up and doing the right thing. These are a bunch of guys who went wayward and did not realize they were corrupted along their way. It’s a community that has lost its way,” said Laanui.

He said he hopes the lawsuit will prompt the school to publicly disclose those who he alleges have broken the law and school policies before taking corrective action.

“We had discussions with Damien’s attorney before the lawsuit was filed, but it became clear that the school is not interested in resolving the matter or ensuring that this conduct is addressed and not swept under the rug,” said Leighton M. Hara of Ota & Hara LLLC, Laanui’s attorneys. “Hawaii’s whistleblower protection laws are there for a reason, to protect individuals from retaliation when they do the right thing and report violations of law. Damien’s conduct is exactly what these laws were meant to stop.”

Laanui said he told the board of directors about his claims of financial irregularities, and members were “shocked by it.”

He said he discovered that “tens of thousands of dollars” in money raised by the Damien Alumni Association, a nonprofit not registered with the Internal Revenue Service, were not being used the way the fundraisers pitched it.

Money raised by alumni, purportedly to support female and male student athletes, for years was “all going to football players” in the form of tuition payments, Laanui alleges.

Laanui said he uncovered and documented violations of Title IX and ILH rules where “Damien through the DAA and football coach” solicited football players by “providing them with scholarships” in violation of ILH recruitment rules prohibiting pay-to-play activities.

Additionally, Laanui said he found “attempted embezzlement” by the varsity and intermediate football coaches where they “falsely submitted a $6,000 invoice for a football banquet,” but “instead, they were going to pocket the money as an unauthorized cash bonus.”

Head football coach Anthony Tuitele and another coach, Ron Dalmacio, filed a lawsuit after they were fired but dropped it and were reinstated in February, the same month the school fired Laanui.

ILH officials did not respond to Star-Advertiser requests for comment.

Damien was in “poor fiscal health,” and Laanui said he made “tough decisions” to improve Damien’s financial well-being, according to the civil complaint.

Auditors described the system Laanui inherited as having “significant material weaknesses” regarding Damien’s internal controls, the complaint continued, and the school was not cooperating with the work of auditors hired to ensure its financial compliance.

Laanui claims that in February 2023 he was told by the school’s athletic director that Tuitele tried to cover up “an on-campus sex incident involving minor students that occurred during a Damien sanctioned football sleepover in October 2022.”

Five students, four football team members and a female equipment manager “engaged in group sex during the sleepover on Damien’s campus,” he alleges.

Laanui said he told the school’s board of directors that the “conduct may be criminal because the girl involved was a minor and incapable of consent.” Damien could be in “violation of the law because the lax supervision by Damien staff allowed for the sexual activity involving minors to occur,” according to the complaint.

The complaint also details more than 40 years of the school’s history of handling sexual misconduct complaints because “Damien has a duty to guard against sexual abuse on campus and should have a heightened awareness for identifying and preventing all forms of sexual abuse.”

“Damien is aware of numerous cases of sexual abuse against former clergy/teachers and have settled the matters through monetary payments,” according to the complaint.

In 2013, the first year Damien admitted girls, a male wrestler allegedly sexually abused a female student on the Damien campus, which prompted a lawsuit.

Damien resolved that lawsuit, also, according to the complaint.

In January 2019, Brother Brian M. Walsh from the Christian Brothers was hired to helm the school, three years after he signed a “$1.9 million settlement with 21 student victims who were abused at Bergen Catholic High School (in New Jersey) between 1963 and 1978, when Brother Walsh was president,” read the complaint.

In June 2020, Damien announced that Walsh would not return and that an interim president, Kyle Ataby, would run the school. Laanui was hired July 1, 2022.

“The hardest thing … I know I’m going against my family here. My family is doing wrong, and I have to take a position against it. … The truth will surface … the truth will reveal itself,” said Laanui. “The facts and the evidence and the data that I have will outweigh the fabrications. I’m pretty confident of that.”","The former president of Damien Memorial School have file a lawsuit accuse the institution of fire him for uncover allege illegal financial management, failure to pay tax, a football player sex scandal and payment to player from alumnus.

Tensions rose during a bipartisan forum this week after an audience question about discrimination reportedly led an Idaho state senator to angrily tell a Native American candidate to “go back where you came from.”

Republican Sen. Dan Foreman left the event early after the outburst and later denied making any racist comments in a Facebook post. 

Trish Carter-Goodheart, a Democratic candidate for the House District 6 seat and member of the Nez Perce Tribe, said the blowup left her shaken and thinking about security needs for future public events. 

“Having conversations about racism with an 8-year-old and a 5-year-old is not something me and my husband Dane were prepared for,” Carter-Goodheart said Friday. “They’ve never seen a grown adult man have a meltdown like that. They were scared. I was scared.”

The event was held by Democratic and Republican precinct committee members from the small north-Idaho town of Kendrick on Monday night. It was for House and Senate candidates from the local district, including Foreman; his Democratic opponent, Julia Parker: Republican Rep. Lori McCann; and her Democratic opponent, Carter-Goodheart.

About an hour into the event, someone asked a question about a state bill addressing discrimination. The candidates were each given two minutes to answer, and when it was Carter-Goodheart’s turn, she pushed back on earlier comments that suggested discrimination is not a major issue in Idaho.

She said state hate crime laws are weak, and noted that the neo-nazi group Aryan Nations made northern Idaho its home base for many years. She also talked about being the only candidate there who was a person of color.

“I pointed out that just because someone hasn’t personally experienced discrimination doesn’t mean it’s not happening,” she said. “I was making my statement, and then he shot up out of his seat and said, ‘I’m so sick of your liberal (expletive). Why don’t you go back to where you came from?’”

The Nez Perce Tribe has lived on the Columbia River Plateau in the Pacific Northwest for more than 11,500 years, including the area where Kendrick is located. The northern edge of its reservation, while only a small fraction of the tribe’s historical territory, is less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall where the forum was held.

In his Facebook post, Foreman called the incident a “quintessential display of race-baiting” and said the Democratic attendees made personal attacks and “proclaimed Idaho to be a racist state.”

“Well, here is a news flash for the lefties out there. There is no systemic racism in America or Idaho,” Foreman said. “Idaho is a great state — the best in the Union!”","Idaho state senator tell Native American candidate ‘ go back where you come from ’ in forum tension rise during a bipartisan forum this week after a audience question about discrimination reportedly lead a Idaho state senator to angrily tell a Native American candidate to “ go back where you come from. ” Republican Sen.

Many of these businesses have failed for the same reason, so I thought maybe it would be helpful if someone who's been watching this game on the sidelines for several years would share their insights.

**Are you Sure?**

When you imagine having your own business, is it doing the work, or having the shop, or imagined social accolades for being a local small business owner? If the dream isn't the work of it, it's probably best to keep this a fantasy.

**The Idea**

I know that many people open the 'business of their dreams' and that they really want to run a coffee shop, or a book store, or a bakery, that they have an idea in mind. And I think having a strong idea that you've designed out in your head is important. 

But. 

I strongly recommend that you spend 6 months in your small town getting out there and talking to people. Participate in local Facebook groups. Join the rotary. Sit in on city council meetings. Donate your time to some sort of universally liked cause like animals. All good ways to find out what the town wants, who they support, and why they support them. Also, being a known value means you will probably get more support than if you just hang out your shingle.

The reality I see is that many of the ideas are informed by city life. While some city trends do eventually make it out to the sticks, some never do. (Boba tea in particular seems to be a huge deal in cities. I do not know what it is, nor have I ever seen it. Someone tried to start a boba tea thing, and it tanked in a week. No one else knew what it was, and no one was that curious either.) Be careful about that.

Other ideas are informed by what fellow retirees want. In general, that's a bit of a problematic demographic for businesses, because of the fixed income and general desire for something that is very often a dying model for a business outside of a very few niche locales.

It is best to stay flexible with your idea by simplifying it. """"I want to run a coffee shop where people can sit down and enjoy the rainy days, and check out boardgames, and linger."""" can turn into """"I want to create a non-alcoholic third space in my town."""" """"I want to run a witchy tarot shop"""" can turn into """"I want to create a space for alternative people in the town."""" """"I want to run a fine dining establishment"""" .... actually, I'll unpack that one in detail.

Fine Dining establishments tank left and right in small towns. If you really dedicate yourself to watching what's going on, you'll see that many restaurants have a """"nice night' several times a year where they serve upmarket food like prime rib, porterhouse steaks, etc. Some places also have a more upscale summer menu and otherwise serve plainer food. The truth is there's simply not enough demand for this type of restaurant in a smaller town. 

*Math: if a dining establishment has only a dozen tables, and let's say they can sit an average of 36 people total, and each table is there for about 2 hours, then if they open at five and close the kitchen at 8 on a weeknight, they need 72 people per evening to be busy. let's say they are only open Thursday through Sunday, and they have a Sunday Brunch service and a Saturday Lunch service which can also serve about 72 people each, so that's 432 diners served per week. Let's say there are 15,000 people in a string of co-located small towns. Let's say 10k of those people are in a position to patronize the restaurant. That's 4% of the available public per week. Every single person in town who could go, would have to go, no less than twice a year to keep the business busy. That's a surprisingly large ask.*

***Stay Flexible with your Idea!***

**Business Hours**

I wasn't really sure where to put this section, but I realized that many people's ideas involve them continuing to work banker's hours. While this can work in touristy spots during the touristy season for that spot, it generally sets people up to fail. There are several stores I'd like to patronize in my town that are open almost exclusively during the hours I, and most everyone else, works. And they close for lunch. 

This could work, again, during touristy season, but in general, shops and restaurants need to be open when people can patronize them. Which is evenings and weekends. If that's not when you want to work, you either need a new idea or you need to hire people. But honestly, if you aren't prepared to work the hours you want to be open, that's going to be a problem, because that's when people will want or need to talk to the owner/manager.

**Skillsets**

Please think about your own skillset and the skillset you need to make the business work. If you haven't managed a retail service business or a restaurant in the last ten years (and especially if you never have) you are going to run into a lot of early problems, and you may run afoul of the law, too. Are you prepared to take classes, work for free at a similar business to learn the ropes, and also have some expensive mistakes? You need to be.

Please also think about the skillsets you need to hire, and more importantly, train. This has been a critical point of failure for many small businesses in my locality. There's a genuine belief that """"anyone"""" can cook/run a register/clean properly. But there's no such thing as an unskilled job. There is unskilled labor (I had to explain how to make change in the last few years) but there is no unskilled job. You can train certain things to an acceptable level of proficiency fairly quickly, but training still needs to happen.

Better skillsets cost more. A lot more than most people imagine. In some cases, they may not be available, and you'll need to go without or do it yourself, or bring someone in who has that skillset and wants a serious change of pace.

A special note on computers and mobile devices. Pretty much every business now has a technology angle. If you do not want to deal with phones or computers, hang it up now. 

**The Staff**

In almost every case, people have to hire some folks for their business. In almost every case I hear the small businesses bitch, moan, whine, and complain about this aspect. This is a problem on many fronts, but let's just talk about staff just now.

1. If your business is open  primarily or just significantly during school hours, it is unlikely to be a job that you can advertise as 'for teenagers.' 
2. Speaking of teenagers, pretty much no one is allowing their kids to work in a kitchen or bar past 11pm, even if it is legal. You will NOT find a 16 year old to run your dishwasher for 8 bucks an hour plus tips on Friday night. It's simply not going to happen. 
3. If your business is open during school pick-up and drop off (we don't necessarily have busses due to funding issues and driver scarcity) it is unlikely you will be able to tap into SAHMs as a resource.
4. For that matter, don't assume that your fellow retirees or transplants want to work.
5. If your business pays less than the average starting wage between the nearest McDonalds and Walmart, you will be unlikely to attract decent labor. Life in small towns used to be cheaper, but it certainly isn't now.
6. If you refuse to hire anyone who isn't squeaky clean, you will struggle to find and keep staff. 
7. If you expect staff to work as hard as you do, you probably aren't ready to run a business. It's not their baby, it's not their profit, and it's not their life. Think about how  hard you worked at your lowest point of productivity and expect that as the bare minimum an employee will do. Be honest about what that looked like.
8. Don't assume that small town values = out dated values. People will absolutely notice if your FOH staff is all cute blonds, and they will talk.
9. Straight wages (no PTO, no benefits) is fine for 20 hours or less each week, but anyone working more needs more. Do better and give it to them.
10. Staff will probably not do the shit job, or if they do, it won't be done the way you want it done. Being the owner tends to mean doing more of the worst work, not less of it.

***Whatever you don't like about staff in the places you've been will also be a problem with the staff you get unless you make a point of being a good place to work.***

**Money**

The biggest question to ask yourself is """"can you afford to fail?""""

If the answer is no, do not start the business. Even in large cities that can support an idea, well over 50% of businesses fail. I'd say that close to 90% of businesses fail in small towns.

If you can't afford to pay staff a living wage, if you can't afford any benefits for full time staff, if you have to work 70 hours a week for free to make things work.... don't start the business.

If you have to take a loan larger than your house value, don't start the business.

***Rescale it, rework the idea, change the hours, etc, etc, etc, until the money works, or don't start the business. You have a much higher than average chance of failing in small town.***

**Don't win at someone else's expense**

My town needed a second-hand shop. We got one. We liked it at first. 

It failed because we all rapidly realized that they were going around to all the charity shops/rummage sales run by the churches, grabbing the good stuff and dramatically marking it up. The  town viewed the shop, quite rightly, as robbing the poorest people in town of the opportunity to have nicer things, and that did not go over all.  

**Accept the Verdict from the Court of Public Opinion with Grace**

Let's go back to the Boba Shop. The owner, when they realized they had no customers,  started a public meltdown in the local FB pages. They were begging people to come try their product. It was not a good look, and, as I recall (though this may not be bang on, since it was a couple years ago and I didn't care that much) someone finally wrote out everything wrong with the business on their posts. They were only open from 9am to 3pm, which realistically meant that more people could only go get their product during lunch. The menu started at ~12 dollars and went up from there, which at the time was equivalent to an hour of work at most businesses. They had set up shop where there was little to no parking nearby, but they also weren't really located in the 'walking district.' At the end of the week they basically told people to 'please come enjoy some free product on me, because I don't really want all this food to rot.' 37 people showed up to try the product for free. I do remember a post in which they kinda chewed out the town for not having more interest in the business, where they shouted that people wouldn't even take it for free.

The town just did not want Boba. Or if they did, not at that price. The owner basically drove themselves out of town with their antics. 

And it was avoidable. As I understood it, people had strongly suggested that they not open the shop, that there was not enough interest. People had strongly suggested that they open during tourist season, because they would get city tourists who would patronize the shop and potentially drive curiosity (because if it's hopping, you might start to wonder why.) People strongly suggested that they do a big free giveaway on their first day or so, or some sort of BOGO deal so people could try to product, since it was novel to most if not all of us. But the owner ignored the court of public opinion at every turn, and that really sunk their ship.

***If the town doesn't like your first idea, if you handle that with grace, they may like your second idea. If you don't handle it with grace, you will probably find yourself iced out of public life. Accept the verdict early and easily.***

**A note on 'theme'**

I can't believe I have to say this, but having a California theme is not going to win you customers. I would suggest no theme at all. But if you must have one, do not have a """"California Beachside"""" theme complete with surfboard and California names for all your products. 

**The Better Idea**

A lot of the ideas I hear from recently arrived persons are very *aesthetic* when small towns really need *basics*.  If you were a mechanic, plumber, contractor, esthetician, childcare specialist, teacher, CDL, machinist, welder, appliance repairman, nurse, doctor, vet, or many of these other types of jobs, consider setting up shop as a part-timer, or joining an outfit as a part-timer. Very often having these types of skills will allow you to set your own hours, and people will tolerate having some over none.","A veritable flood of semi - retire / retire folk have flood into my town in the last 18 month, and many of them have start a business.

There's a genuine belief that "" "" anyone "" "" can cook / run a register / clean properly. But there's no such thing as a unskilled job. There be unskilled labor ( I have to explain how to make change in the last few year ) but there be no unskilled job. You can train certain thing to a acceptable level of proficiency fairly quickly, but train still need to happen. good skillsets cost much. A lot much than much people imagine. In some case, they may not be available, and you'll need to go without or do it yourself, or bring someone in who have that skillset and want a serious change of pace. A special note on computer and mobile device. Pretty much every business now have a technology angle. If you do not want to deal with phone or computer, hang it up now. * * The Staff * * In almost every case, people have to hire some folk for their business. In almost every case I hear the small business bitch, moan, whine, and complain about this aspect. This be a problem on many front, but let's just talk about staff just now. 1. If your business be open primarily or just significantly during school hour, it be unlikely to be a job that you can advertise as ' for teenager. ' 2. speak of teenager, pretty much no one be allow their kid to work in a kitchen or bar past 11pm, even if it be legal. You will NOT find a 16 year old to run your dishwasher for 8 buck a hour plus tip on Friday night. It's simply not go to happen. 3. If your business be open during school pick - up and drop off ( we don't necessarily have bus due to fund issue and driver scarcity ) it be unlikely you will be able to tap into SAHMs as a resource. 4. For that matter, don't assume that your fellow retiree or transplant want to work. 5. If your business pay little than the average start wage between the near McDonalds and Walmart, you will be unlikely to attract decent labor. Life in small town use to be cheap, but it certainly isn't now. 6. If you refuse to hire anyone who isn't squeaky clean, you will struggle to find and keep staff. 7. If you expect staff to work as hard as you do, you probably aren't ready to run a business. It's not their baby, it's not their profit, and it's not their life. Think about how hard you work at your low point of productivity and expect that as the bare minimum a employee will do. Be honest about what that look like. 8. Don't assume that small town value = out date value. People will absolutely notice if your FOH staff be all cute blond, and they will talk. 9. Straight wage ( no PTO, no benefit ) be fine for 20 hour or little each week, but anyone work much need much. Do good and give it to them. 10. Staff will probably not do the shit job, or if they do, it won't be do the way you want it do. be the owner tend to mean do much of the bad work, not little of it. * * * Whatever you don't like about staff in the place you've be will also be a problem with the staff you get unless you make a point of be a good place to work. * * * * * Money * * The big question to ask yourself be "" "" can you afford to fail? "" "" If the answer be no, do not start the business. Even in large city that can support a idea, good over 50 % of business fail. I'd say that close to 90 % of business fail in small town. If you can't afford to pay staff a live wage, if you can't afford any benefit for full time staff, if you have to work 70 hour a week for free to make thing work.... don't start the business. If you have to take a loan large than your house value, don't start the business. * * * Rescale it, rework the idea, change the hour, etc, etc, etc, until the money work, or don't start the business. You have a much high than average chance of fail in small town. * * * * * Don't win at someone else's expense * * My town need a 2 - hand shop. We get one. We like it at first. It fail because we all rapidly realize that they be go around to all the charity shop / rummage sale run by the church, grab the good stuff and dramatically mark it up. The town view the shop, quite rightly, as rob the poor people in town of the opportunity to have nice thing, and that do not go over all. * * Accept the Verdict from the Court of Public Opinion with Grace * * Let's go back to the Boba Shop. The owner, when they realize they have no customer, start a public meltdown in the local FB page. They be beg people to come try their product. It be not a good look, and, as I recall ( though this may not be bang on, since it be a couple year ago and I didn't care that much ) someone finally write out everything wrong with the business on their post. They be only open from 9am to 3pm, which realistically mean that much people can only go get their product during lunch. The menu start at ~12 dollar and go up from there, which at the time be equivalent to a hour of work at much business. They have set up shop where there be little to no park nearby, but they also weren't really locate in the ' walk district. ' At the end of the week they basically tell people to ' please come enjoy some free product on me, because I don't really want all this food to rot. ' 37 people show up to try the product for free. I do remember a post in which they kinda chew out the town for not have much interest in the business, where they shout that people wouldn't even take it for free. The town just do not want Boba. Or if they do, not at that price. The owner basically drive themselves out of town with their antic. And it be avoidable. As I understand it, people have strongly suggest that they not open the shop, that there be not enough interest. People have strongly suggest that they open during tourist season, because they would get city tourist who would patronize the shop and potentially drive curiosity ( because if it's hop, you may start to wonder why. ) People strongly suggest that they do a big free giveaway on their first day or so, or some sort of BOGO deal so people can try to product, since it be novel to much if not all of us. But the owner ignore the court of public opinion at every turn, and that really sink their ship. * * * If the town doesn't like your first idea, if you handle that with grace, they may like your 2 idea. If you don't handle it with grace, you will probably find yourself ice out of public life. Accept the verdict early and easily. * * * * * A note on 'theme' * * I can't believe I have to say this, but have a California theme be not go to win you customer. I would suggest no theme at all. But if you must have one, do not have a "" "" California Beachside "" "" theme complete with surfboard and California name for all your product. * * The good Idea * * A lot of the idea I hear from recently arrive person be very * aesthetic * when small town really need * basic *. If you be a mechanic, plumber, contractor, esthetician, childcare specialist, teacher, CDL, machinist, welder, appliance repairman, nurse, doctor, vet, or many of this other type of job, consider set up shop as a part - timer, or join a outfit as a part - timer. Very often have this type of skill will allow you to set your own hour, and people will tolerate have some over none.","Idaho","So you want to start a business in smalltown Idaho...","So you want to start a business in smalltown Idaho...","{""choices"":[""Economy and Finance"",""Transportation and Infrastructure"",""Culture and Recreation""]}","2024-11-19T00:51:30.225839Z","https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/1fc3d9n/so_you_want_to_start_a_business_in_smalltown_idaho/"

I am currently on day 240 of walking across America with my stroller “Smiley.” I have been in St. Louis for the past week, but am preparing to start back up again on Monday and cross the Mississippi into Illinois. 

I will be heading through southern Illinois on my way to Cave-In-Rock to cross over into KY. I’m sure that I would love to see more of the state, but I will need to head south to avoid the Winter up north. If anyone has any recommendations for things to do or see while in southern IL, I would love to hear them. Additionally if anyone knows anyone knows anyone on the way from St Louis to Cave-In-Rock that may be able to help host me, that would be incredible. I should have some hosts in Belleville, Harrisburg, and West Frankfurt but more never hurts.

Part of the reason I am doing the walk is to raise money for AmericaWalks, which is a national pedestrian advocacy and walkability organization. The most dangerous thing I deal with while walking is cars and in that way the advocacy is built into the activity. So if anyone is interested in making America a more walkable place and more pleasant for those outside of cars, I’d highly recommend checking them out and consider supporting their mission. 

Other than that, I am excited to see my 8th and shortest (so far) state of the walk. It should take me about a week from Monday to get through. If anyone would like to follow along, the best place to do that is walk2washington on IG, FB, or .com.

Thanks,
HMR","Howdy Y ’ all, I be currently on day 240 of walk across America with my stroller “ Smiley. ” I have be in St. Louis for the past week, but be prepare to start back up again on Monday and cross the Mississippi into Illinois.

My name is Jackie and I'm running for office as the first openly transgender person to ever run in my county! (And the second one to run in the state)

I'm also an engineer, DND nerd, avid biker, and have a [candidate page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556081158535) if you're interested in checking it out.

My views can vastly be described as """"pretty moderate."""" Although I'm running Democrat because those moderate views align mostly with viewing the govt as a service to the community and against the people who seem to want me dead and want to control every aspect of your life from your medical decisions to your religious practices.

While this position I wouldn't be making state wide decisions (like legalizing marijuana, implementing ranked choice voting, and banning corporations from owning residential property), it will be a stepping stone to prove myself worthy of eventually being able to help out this whole state.

And on the other end we have a guy who said he's okay with the idea that states should have a right to ensure people don't get married if they are not of the same race.

Seriously as a personal point as a Muslim and I think Christians should think the same thing as well. This idea that government can define someone's race goes against what the Abrahamic religions teach. That Adam PBUH is the father of all mankind so there are no different races. A white is not superior to a black and so on we are all equal in the sight of God. So it does make me question what is the point of this if we have a governor who thinks states have the right to define marriage in such a way that prevents black and white from marriage. And banning interracial marriage brings a lot of questions like people who are mix race like how would this work.

So much for being a party for God right. No really Christians are the ones trying so hard to push there is no such thing as race but then here's Mike Braun being the most likely candidate for governor and saying he believes states have the right to say black people can't marry white people.

Really I do think government should stay out of a lot of things including marriage. While yeah some would say states rights gets the federal government out of things it doesn't get state government out which is my problem. The federal government seems to be doing a good enough job keeping the state government out of things.

Not only this but remember he also said the people at IU were antisemitic and he stand with the police. I think police should come to his door because if accusing someone of being antisemitic for supporting Palestine means anything he has a lot to answer for with his interracial marriage comments.","So for governor we have a former teacher who be will to actually care about education and will to care about civil right.

Dear user,

As you may know, your elected officials in Indiana are requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access to our website. While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users, and in fact, will put children and your privacy at risk.

In addition, mandating age verification without proper enforcement gives platforms the opportunity to choose whether or not to comply. As we’ve seen in other states, this just drives traffic to sites with far fewer safety measures in place. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust [Trust and Safety measures](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/categories/4419836212499-Our-Commitment-to-Trust-and-Safety) we currently have in place. To protect children and user privacy, any legislation must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.

The safety of our users is one of our biggest concerns. We believe that the best and most effective solution for protecting children and adults alike is to identify users by their device and allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that identification. Until a real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Indiana.

Please contact your representatives before it is too late and demand device-based verification solutions that make the internet safer while also respecting your privacy.

On June 30th, 2023 the Indiana Supreme Court decided in a 4-1 decision that an Abortion Ban was constitutional, and allowed the law to continue. 

Three of those Justices, specifically Mark Massa, Derek Molter, and Lorette Rush are on the ballot this year. Although we may not be able to choose their replacements, we can prevent them from getting another 10 years in office. 

Abortion is healthcare. Strict Abortion laws help no one, and will only hurt women who need one.

We've seen this time and time again, such as the case of [Kristen Anaya](https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-sepsis-life-saving-abortion-care-texas/story?id=99294313) who despite having lost her baby, was forced to continously get sicker until she went into sepsis until she would be allowed to get an abortion, or [Jaci Statton](https://www.businessinsider.com/oklahoma-woman-told-wait-in-parking-lot-until-crashing-abortion-2023-4?op=1) was told to wait in the parking lot until she was sick enough to be helped medically, and ended up driving to another state to get one. There are hundreds of examples like this. These are all women who wanted to be pregnant, who wanted to have babies and many of these women became infertile afterwards.

Banning Abortion does not protect life. It endangers it. We must tell our government that it is not okay to force women to suffer like this. We need to band together, and force everyone who allowed the abortion ban out of office. 

Not only are these 3 supreme court justices on the ballot, but so is the position of attourney general, governer, state senate and house, along with more local positions. 

Do not just vote for president this election, do not just vote federally. Vote all the way down the ballot. Turnout for elections (during presidental years) is only at 65%, don't let anyone convince you that indiana can't be better, that it can't be blue. Show up and Vote. 

Unfortunately, we can't directly choose their replacements. The governor will be responsible for that, so it's important to vote for a governor who cares about women's rights. The Democratic Nominee for Governor is Mccormick. Check her out!

>“The 2024 report finds that Indiana’s 2024 Housing Wage of $22.07 needed to afford a two-bedroom rental unit, valued at the Fair Market Rate of $1,148, is an increase of $3.07 per hour above the 2023 Housing Wage. However, the average Hoosier renter’s wage of $17.92 per hour in 2024 increased by only $0.06 over the past year,”

>The average Hoosier wage falls short in 88 of 92 counties and in 25 of the state’s 26 metro areas, according to the report. Additionally, many of Indiana’s core job sectors don’t pay wages high enough to cover the Fair Market Rate for a two-bedroom apartment. 

>“For the first time in recent history, less than a third of Indiana’s Top 20 largest occupations pay wages sufficient to meet the state’s Housing Wage,”

>“Only a quarter of Hoosiers working in the state’s most popular occupations earn enough on average to afford rent.""""

>Just six of Indiana’s 20 most common occupations paid a full-time wage enough to afford a two-bedroom rental unit, down from 10 occupations in 2023.

Advocates are rightfully up in arms over this, arguing that ID-based verification exposes users to risks of cyber-attacks and data breaches. But I feel like it’s not only that. It’s more about the fact that you have to hand over your personal information. This feels like a total invasion of privacy.

I’m debating on getting a VPN not only cause it will potentially help bypass these ridiculous restrictions, but also protects your identity online. Considering the discounts I've seen mentioned everywhere, NordVPN goes as low as 3 bucks per month, making it a pretty solid option in my eyes.

I'm a West Coast graphic designer who heard about y'all's license plate dilemma, so here's my take on it! 

My design fits your governor's design criteria and is a hybrid of various standard and vanity license plates throughout Kansas history. I put in a lot of research before I put out any design, but I'm curious as to what people from Kansas think about it.

\---

For some background, I completed a passion project two years ago where I redesigned the license plates for all American states & territories and Canadian provinces & territories. I challenged myself to create entirely new designs for each jurisdiction, regardless of whether or not I liked their current ones.

*^((I've made a few tweaks to my original Kansas redesign to fit the license plate criteria))*

For those near Kansas City this is an easy and worthwhile day trip. Bring some snacks, water, and a blanket for a picnic after your hike.

I submitted a claim for Kentucky Unemployment and was approved on January 21st, 2024. Since January 21st, my claim has remained under fact finding. Following KY UI protocols, I have requested payment every two weeks, proving that I applied for a minimum of 5 jobs in hopes that maybe this week, my direct deposit will come through... 


On February 21st, I emailed NKY Career Center to see if they required anything else from me because a month later there were still no funds received.  Now I understand, there is a fear of those in the unemployment system who may take advantage or abuse the process. While that is often very few people, many of us are trying to follow the system properly, follow the rules, and it feels like we are let down for doing so.  I went onsite to Covington's KY Career Center on Friday, February 23rd in hopes that it would help speed up the process to receive my payment. I uploaded a copy of my marriage certificate to prove that my last name legally changed in case that was somehow causing a hold-up. I have triple-checked my direct deposit to make sure that it is entered correctly. It is. 

I apply for 30+ positions each week, easily. I've been watching my spending and budgeting so as not to use my credit card an exorbitant amount. I have a Master's Degree, and formerly worked in HR, and it has been a struggle to find a position. It was only this week alone that I finally achieved one interview. It is now March 8th, 2024 and my claim is still under fact-finding. I was told that it could be up to 16 weeks before my claim is fully processed...Thats 4 months! It’s to my understanding that fact-finding is held with the adjudication branch in Frankfort, and there has been quite a backlog at the moment. The cause of the backlog is unknown to me, though. 

The current system and waiting 16 weeks is hurting others more than helping. The majority of us are not lazy, not-wanting-to-work, expecting-handouts-individuals. We simply are in a difficult situation, asking for assistance while we find our next position without undermining our worth.  

I understand that there is not much more I can do, but needed to vent. I will most likely be applying for a waitressing job on Monday while continuing to search for an opening elsewhere in HR.

I finished walking through Kentucky a couple days back after taking 4 days to get from Cave-In-Rock, IL to Clarksville, TN. It was the shortest state of the walk, so I don’t feel as though I got to learn as much about the state as other places where I spent more time. However, just like the rest of the country I got to explore a place I had never been to before and meet plenty of kind strangers along the way.

After getting across the Ohio river I hopped onto SR-91, which to my surprise was also the literal Trail of Tears route. I was on SR-91 all the way until Hopkinsville and can’t say it was the best place to walk. From my experience, unlike on US designated highways like US-41, state highways don’t have to provide shoulders. As such, they have usually been some of my least favorite places to walk. However, since the area I was in was amish country, I do think drivers were a little more considerate of sharing the road because of the tendency to see horse and buggies. 

I followed this path through Marion and into Fredonia where I was gifted some free food at the gas station by the clerks. Although the plan was to get a tall boi to celebrate getting into the state, that gas station (the only one in Fredonia) didn’t sell alcohol. That was the first time that had happened in 250+ days of the walk including when I walked through Utah and Kansas. It was something of a shock to me. But I found a place to sleep and started off the next morning. 

Next day I passed through Princeton and had lunch at a Mexican restaurant (typical cuisine for me). I met some nice guys who paid for my meal and told me that the talk of the town was that the football team got busted for drugs (which I assumed to be weed lol). Walked along the rest of the day and pitched my tent at a church with a little covering to protect me from the rain that night.

The third day was me making my way to Hopkinsville. It was a little rainy on the day, but nothing too bad. I got into Hopkinsville and immediately started seeing some strange sights including a street named “Dink Embrys Buttermilk,” a memorial and flag commemorating Jefferson Davis highway (who I learned was born not far for there), and outside of a gun store was a very large replica of Donatello from the Michael Bay adaptation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Fortunate to pay a visit to the Trail of Tears commemorative park, but the site could definitely use some love, care and support. Eventually I made it to my lovely hosts for the night, Beth and Barry in Hopkinsville, who fed me, let me do some laundry and gave me a warm place to sleep. They even invited me to their son’s wedding, if I can make it down to Atlanta by January 13th. One of the things that I have done along the walk is trade items with the folks that host me that either have some significance to them or their area. So with Barry and Beth, I got to trade a Christmas decoration that was made from one of my hosts near Harrisburg, IL for another Christmas ornament from Hopkinsville Community College, as well as a lucky horseshoe (very Kentucky).

On the last day of walking through Kentucky, I was able to take US-41A, which although busy, had a wide shoulder. Took that highway all the way to Oak Grove and Fort Campbell, the army base for the 101st airborne division. After that I did my little photo op with the “Welcome to Tennessee” sign and crossed into the Volunteer State.

Much like the other states of my walk, cars were the most dangerous and difficult challenge that I faced, corresponding with the lack of infrastructure to accommodate folks outside of cars. This only reaffirmed my conviction to raise money and awareness for AmericaWalks, the leading national walkability and pedestrian advocacy organization. If you would like to create more walkable communities, enable less car dependency, and build a safer Kentucky for those both outside and inside of cars, then please consider donating to and checking out AmericaWalks at AmericaWalks.org. Additionally most of this work happens at the state and local level, so I encourage people to get active and involved locally.

Also like other states all of the folks I met in Kentucky were kind and generous people who helped me out along my journey. My only regret is that I didn’t get the opportunity to meet more of them.

I appreciate you Kentucky and I hope to be back someday to explore other parts of the state.

Sincerely and thanks,
HMR","Howdy Y ’ all, I finish walk through Kentucky a couple day back after take 4 day to get from Cave - In - Rock, IL to Clarksville, TN. It be the short state of the walk, so I don ’ t feel as though I get to learn as much about the state as other place where I spend much time. However, just like the rest of the country I get to explore a place I have never be to before and meet plenty of kind stranger along the way.

(Excerpts from linked article.)
When bitcoin was on a hot streak, owners of small industrial facilities in Kentucky struck up crypto mining partnerships with Chinese companies. Then things fell apart.

The firm shipped equipment from China to its hosting facility in Eastern Kentucky, then walked away with the bitcoin produced, leaving behind hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid energy bills and hosting fees.

Even if the Kentucky facility owners win out in court, it could be difficult to collect any damages awarded. “A judgment is essentially a piece of paper. Any judgment needs to be turned into assets or cash in order to be valuable,” says Havlin. If the opposing party refuses to pay up and has no US assets to collect against, sometimes that isn’t possible.","( excerpt from link article. ) When bitcoin be on a hot streak, owner of small industrial facility in Kentucky strike up crypto mine partnership with Chinese company.

I am currently on day 249 of walking across America with my stroller “Smiley.” I am currently near Harrisburg, IL and am planning to take the ferry at Cave-In-Rock over the Ohio river into Kentucky on Wednesday.

The plan is to take SR-91 to Hopkinsville and then take US-41 to Guthrie. I’m sure that I would love to see more of the state, but I’m heading south to avoid the Winter on my way to Nashville. If anyone has any recommendations for things to do or see while in Western KY, I would love to hear them. Additionally if anyone knows anyone along my route that may be able to host, that would be incredible. I should have some hosts in Hopkinsville, but I'm always looking for ways to sleep inside as it gets colder.

Part of the reason I am doing the walk is to raise money for AmericaWalks, which is a national pedestrian advocacy and walkability organization. The most dangerous thing I deal with while walking is cars and in that way the advocacy is built into the activity. So if anyone is interested in making America a more walkable place and more pleasant for those outside of cars, I’d highly recommend checking them out and consider supporting their mission. 

Other than that, I am excited to see my 9th and shortest (so far) state of the walk. It should take me about 4 or 5 days to get through. If anyone would like to follow along, the best place to do that is walk2washington on IG, FB, or .com.

Thanks,
HMR","Howdy Y ’ all, I be currently on day 249 of walk across America with my stroller “ Smiley. ” I be currently near Harrisburg, IL and be plan to take the ferry at Cave - In - Rock over the Ohio river into Kentucky on Wednesday.

For what purpose?

Billionaires don't want small businesses to succeed because they perceive us as a threat to their power. Everything else is just talking points that they're using to justify their anti-free market and anti-business stances.

What will occur in the aftermath of this?

Jobs will be lost. Businesses will close. The state will further become a black hole for entrepreneurship and growing businesses. The state will lose millions in revenue in the short term and tens of millions in the long term, much of which goes directly to fund early childhood education. The black market will thrive.

Call and email every single representative in the state house (and senate if you are able) and ask them politely to not kill jobs and small businesses, to support the free market, to support legal and safe hemp products, and to do what is right for the citizens of this state, not the billionaires who control it.","Yesterday the Senate pass SB237.

5. Trees. So many trees. I love it. The evergreens must look beautiful in the winter time! 
6. It's so spooky at night... love the stars though.
7. Crab > Lobster - fight me.
8. You have a distinct lack of Indian cuisine in Maine - couldn't find a curry outside of Portland.
9. This isn't specific to Maine, but sales tax can go to hell, or at least be included in the advertised price.
10. There was 2 hour free street parking in so many locations I went to - this is non-existent in populated areas in the UK,
11. In this order, I saw bald eagles, otter, chipmunk,, wild turkeys.

1)This is extremely standard in other town and state subs I follow, and people think of Reddit as a crowdsourcing resource so they aren’t and have no reason to be expecting to get a slap on the wrist. 

2) if you allow these threads to stay active, people can search for them instead of posting new similar posts, which will allow for fewer of these types of posts overall, and you’ll have a record of amazing recommendations… instead of a megathread that is not searchable and again, no one is seeing or looking at.

My small hospital gave me the option of traveling to two different hospitals, both over an hour from my home. I am due in the middle of January. The thought of driving over an hour while in active labor possibly in inclement weather is not something I want to be doing. 

I am stuck. I have no where to give birth. I reached out to a birthing center somewhat near me (closer than the other hospitals), but I can’t afford to do much without insurance, and insurance doesn’t cover out of hospital births. 

MaineHealth is also trying to CLOSE the birthing center at my local hospital, which would leave every woman in my county in my position.

Nobody tells you how hard starting over is when you leave DV. The loneliness can be unbearable at times. Just working (from home) 50+ hours a week, and raising 2 little kids with zero help, I’ve been at my wits end. Yesterday I got some bad news, and it was just the icing on my shit cake that is my life. I drove my kids to daycare and then just drove aimlessly in a fog of depression like, are things *ever* going to get better for me?! How much do I have to take until whoever is playing my character in this weird ass simulation finds some cheat codes?! /s kinda lol.

As I drove there was a man out front of his house doing yard work, when I drove by he gave me the most genuine smile as he waved hello, I burst into tears. Just having someone acknowledge my existence and smile… idk it helped. A mile or so down the road I had to wait for a horse drawn cart with the Amish (?) family to pass, and every single one of them waved at me and smiled. When I got home I had to get the mail, walking to the mailbox someone dove by, honked and raised a few fingers off the wheel in the unofficial Maine Salute. I cannot express to you folks how it feels to be *seen* when you feel invisible. When your days are filled with the same job day after day after day, the only human interaction you have is with customers or your children… it kept me going yesterday.

So among the “why did this person honk at me” posts I figured I would jump in and say thank you to those of you who still wave at strangers, you never know what somebody else is going through, and your kindness might be the only kindness they receive that day. Thank you.","I wasn ’ t sure how to title this post, but I want to say thank you. Nobody tell you how hard start over be when you leave DV. The loneliness can be unbearable at time.

It's the same road, different names on either end.

In the middle it's a farming road. It's crop season and the local farmers will absolutely be cranking down this road with their equipment. There are spots where it's not wide enough for you and them, and they can't stop on a dime. 🚜
It's also gravel, some decent sized rocks.

I come from Texas by the way. I just wanted to share what my experience has been like so far. I will not be discussing anything political in this post, or in the comments.

**1. Traffic**

Maryland has, without exaggeration, the worst traffic I have ever experienced. I used to think that a 15 minute drive is a long drive, but now it's a short drive for me. A lot of my time is spent just sitting in my car without moving... on an expressway. While not as bad as I-35, traffic in Maryland is in general much worse than Texas.

A lot of this seems to be caused by bad traffic design, like having cloverleaf freeway interchanges and no access roads. There's also no dedicated U-turn lanes or turnarounds. However, this isn't really the fault of the government, because some of the roads are extremely old, and were built in a time period before they were widely used.

On the bright side, there aren't any lifted trucks here. All the people here who drive crazy are in small cars, and not in a giant F-150 that's like 8 feet off the ground. This has been an AMAZING change compared to where I live in Texas... there's idiots in lifted trucks everywhere.

**2. The Weather**

In my original post, people told me that I would be miserable and that """"it's not a dry heat"""". Honestly the weather here is MUCH nicer than where I live in Texas. Most of Texas has far more humidity than Maryland, and often gets much hotter. Also, Texas doesn't cool off at night. Some of my Maryland friends were complaining that it was 95F outside, which I thought was funny. xD

**3. The Food**

Maryland easily has way better seafood restaurants than anywhere in Texas. I tried a crab cake, and it was heaven in my mouth. Also, the oysters here are fresh, unlike in Corpus Christi. No seafood in Texas even comes close to the restaurants in Maryland.

Maryland's fast food is also not as greasy compared to Texas. I think that the food in Maryland is way healthier than in Texas. Even the Chick Fil A here doesn't have as much castor oil compared to the Chick Fil A in Texas.

However, there's no good BBQ or hot wing joints close to where I live in Maryland, which sucks. Also no Whataburger either. HEB doesn't exist up here either, and if you don't know, HEB is pretty much Whole Foods but with Walmart prices.

**4. Accessibility**

A lot of big stores like Bass Pro Shop and Dick's Sporting Goods are within driving distance. I'm used to having to drive 2 hours to get to Houston or San Antonio to go shopping or play Top Golf, but here, everything's wayyyy closer. This is definitely a nice change, and there's way more spots to hang out with people.

Also, there's like 3 different international airports that are all close to each other. That's not the same where I live in Texas... I would have to drive 2 hours to get to an airport xD

**Conclusion**

Honestly Maryland is not that bad of a place to be in once you get over the traffic. I'm pretty glad I'm spending my summer up here, and it's been great to experience a completely different part of the United States.","About 2 month ago, I ask some question about what Maryland would be like, because I would be spend my whole summer up here.

After they had her cleaned up, etc is when the trouble started. It was discovered that I had placenta acreta. My placenta had attached too deeply into my uterine wall and wasn't coming unattached. They even went in manually and tried to remove it with their hands but it crumbled apart in pieces and started coming out like ground hamburger. This isn't a condition that with our current technology can be diagnosed with ultrasound unless the placenta burrows completely through the uterine wall so the only way it is discovered is after birth and it leads to massive hemmorhage because the uterus can't clamp down to stop the bleeding from labor.  Standard treatment is an emergency D&C to remove the placenta and any remaining tissue to control the bleeding. I was able to receive this life saving treatment, but even with it I lost 1/3 of my blood volume and it took me nearly 4 months to get back to full strength. And all this took place at 40 weeks of pregnancy/post birth.

When a woman, for whatever reason, whether it be miscarriage, fetal anomily, etc, requires a surgical termination of her pregnancy, the procedure done is also a D&C. 

When the hospital enters the procedure into your health records there is NO seperate Code or Procedure that would differentiate the two. They write the facts and that is it. Patient received This drug. Patient had this procedure. Patient was x weeks pregnant. Removed this tissue from uterus. Etc. 

By writing a law that would put a time limit on surgical abortions what is actually being banned is the D&C procedure and if the time limit is say 24 weeks, then women like myself who retain their placenta or other post partum tissue and hemmorhage, would be left to bleed to death or get sepsis and die. Even if the law is written to make exceptions for """"the life of the mother"""" we have already seen where doctors have been forced to wait and determine how close to death the woman has to be before they can intervene. You can't play games with lives like that. I remember that day in the hospital. I remember the midwife looking at my mother and in a whisper telling her that the placenta wasn't coming out and my cervix had closed and when my mother asked what that meant my midwife very seriously said """"your daughter could bleed to death."""" And my mother had to leave the room before she burst into tears. She came back barely holding it together with my grandmother and my father on the phone and held it up to my ear because I was so weak by then I couldnt do it myself and they both asked if I could hear them and told me to be strong because I had a new baby I couldnt leave behind. While the doctors were rushing around to prep me. Then they looked at my husband and told him. """"If you want to say goodbye now is your last chance to do it."""" 

And my husband leaned over and kissed me with tears in his eyes and squeezed my hand and told me he loved me. And I told him I would see him when I woke up. And then the doctors were racing me down the hallway but I passed out before we made it to the elevator. 

Now imagine that being your wife or your daughter only instead of it being the doctor saying they """"could"""" bleed to death they tell you that they are """"going"""" to bleed to death because they are 34 weeks or further along in their pregnancy and even though the baby is BORN and safely sleeping in the nursery, in the eyes of the law the life saving D&C is still an abortion because they are removing fetal tissue. That is what putting a time limit on abortions will ultimately cost. The lives of women and loved ones. We have already seen it in the news to two women in Georgua and while they were much earlier in their pregnancies, the life saving orocedure they needed was still the same one I had, a D&C and they didnt receive it because it was past the time limit that was set by lawmakers instead of the decision being left to the doctors in charge of her care.

I'm not asking you to change your mind on abortion I'm simply asking you to consider that it is impossible to write a law that sets a time limit that would also allow for exceptions for every possible medical emergency that could arise. Leave the doctoring to the doctors regardless of your personal faith or feelings on the matter and instead think what YOU would want the doctor to be allowed to do if YOU got the phone call that your child or wife was bleeding to death but they could save her vs if they were going to bleed to death and legally the doctors cant save them so you need to say your goodbyes because they are going to die.

The initiative aims to revive neighborhoods with high crime rates and surplus vacant homes.
The city tried a similar housing program in the 1970s with homesteaders. 
The city of Baltimore will sell more than 200 city-owned abandoned homes to residents starting at just $1 each in an effort to revive some of its roughest neighborhoods.

A city board approved the measure on Wednesday in a 4-1 vote, according to The Baltimore Sun.

The Maryland city's crime rates have led to a surplus of vacant homes in certain neighborhoods. According to the city, there are about 15,000 abandoned properties in Baltimore.

The $1 home project approved this week targets about 200 of those city-owned residences. The properties will be marketed to Baltimore residents who commit to restoring and living in the homes.

The program is meant to incentivize Baltimore locals to buy up the cheap properties, though developers and nonprofits can also purchase the vacant homes — for $3,000, according to local news reports.

The city is offering home repair grants of $50,000 to individuals who are pre-approved for a construction loan, Bloomberg reported.

Baltimore implemented a similar housing project in the 1970s when it offered homesteaders the chance to snatch up $1 abandoned properties if they promised to fix them up.

The modern version of the project has backing from Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, but some city council members raised concerns. Baltimore City Council President Nick Mosby, during a Wednesday meeting, questioned whether Scott's administration had done enough to make sure Baltimore locals are given first dibs on the homes, citing concerns that the project could eventually lead to poorer people being pushed out, The Sun reported.","Baltimore be sell city - own abandon home to resident for $1 each.

My name is Wednesday, and I’m that dog who just doesn’t seem to get it right, even when I’m trying my best. Let me explain–I always get it right in my foster home. There, I’m such a good girl. I listen to instructions, I think I’m a lap dog, I get in there for bear hugs and I take very good care of my little stuffies. I like to deep sleep with my face buried right into the humans’ chests because their heartbeat makes me feel safe. I appreciate my treats, my bed, breakfast, dinner and all of my toys. I remember what it was like to not have these things before coming to BARCS.

But, when it’s time to meet new people, that’s when I always seem to mess it up, even though I don’t mean to.
When I’m outside of my foster home, I’m just not myself, and people get the wrong impression of me. I scream with excitement, I scramble and hyperfixate on just about everything except the people right in front of my face. I just don’t know what comes over me. By the time I’m ready to connect with potential new families, they’ve moved on to meet other dogs. Sometimes, they even act like they’re scared of me, all because of my screams and jumps. I wish I didn’t do that, but I just can’t seem to get it right.

It also upsets all the other dogs at the adoption events, so everyone says it’s best for me to just stay home and sit them out. 😞

Back in April, however, there was a wonderful girl who did take a chance on me and I got adopted. She really loved me, and I loved her too. When we met, she wasn’t startled by me like so many people are. She waited for me to calm down, and I made sure to be an extra good girl–even if that meant I was vibrating heavily while trying to hold my sit. But I did it. I showed her I was going to be a wonderful companion and her best friend. When we got home, I kept all my good manners—my crate training, my potty training, and how I took care of my toys and stuffies like they were my babies. But then something really sad happened. Her job changed, and she had to travel almost 100% of the time. She had to leave faster than she thought, and her job told her she would be gone for months. They didn’t even give us enough time to figure it out. She told me she loved me and didn’t want me to live a whole life with pet sitters, so she asked my foster family if they would take me back.

I really thought she was the one. But now I have to try again.

Next week, I’m coming up on my two-year anniversary of being “Wednesday With No Last Name.” Yes, BARCS and my fosters believe in me and have stuck it out for two years.

But with the shelter out of space and struggling with funding, it’s not fair to other dogs who need a chance too if I can’t find a home. And I know you’re going to ask—“Wednesday, why can’t you just get adopted by your foster family?” Well, they have another dog like me named Short Rib, whose life they also saved from BARCS. We both do not like other dogs, so we have to live “half lives” in the house. I live upstairs, and he lives downstairs. Every day that I’m there, I take his mom and dad away from him 50% of the time.

And that’s not fair to Short Rib. It’s also not fair to me. I want a full-time mom or dad all to myself—and I think I deserve one. But I just need to find the right humans. They can’t have another puppy or any kitties. And I probably will live best with kids who are old enough to understand that I have those little quirks when I’m not at home, and can get pretty bouncy.

The BARCS social media girls have posted me dozens of times, and no one ever shares my posts. We really need it to work this time, so can you please help share my letter? Tell everyone that “Wednesday With No Last Name” is a velco puppy and sure to be someone's next heart dog. Tell them, that I am loyal and won’t ever forget that they are the ones who saw past my flaws and gave me a chance...

...to get it right.

Seriously take into context that at the most they had 4 minutes of warning or realistically 90 seconds to close a bridge over 1.5 miles long. Listening to the officer's audio of getting the call, jumping into action and even immediately thinking of the crew that was working on the bridge and trying to get in contact with the foreman on site.

I want you to sit back and think about this scale. 90 seconds to close a bridge over a mile and a half long. Think of any other situation where the authorities needed to react quickly and most of these stories end in horrific circumstances. BUT NOT IN MARYLAND!

This is not an act of single heroism, this is having the right protocols, with the right authorities with people who were well trained to follow those plans that we have placed. This is not to diminish the work of the individuals who carried out the efforts.

I'm not typically a huge supporter of law enforcement but this shit right here is how you get people to have some faith in authority figures by having them do their roles in the community. We need to give them their proper dues for how great of a job they did in this instance.

We won't remember this in the years to come. There will be no songs sung of the tragedy of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, no books written, and no documentaries made. You won't tell your children of this incident 20 years from now.

This is what success in disaster does simply fades into the past, a footnote in the history of Maryland. We really should take a ton of pride in how well this state did in the face of catastrophic bad luck.

My heart goes out to those who did lose their lives and those still unaccounted for. your families are in our thoughts and will be a reminder that even though we did well, we can still do better.

TLDR: Maryland handled a terrible event impressively when more often than not this is a national tragedy. Go Maryland.

The campaign ads are featured on and around public transportation, on billboards, and across digital throughout the commonwealth. This campaign has already played a large role in keeping residents well-informed on the dangers of these deceptive and dangerous facilities.

**ICYMI — About Anti-Abortion Centers**

Anti-abortion centers are facilities that pretend to be reproductive health care clinics, but actually exist to dissuade people from accessing abortion care.

These, often religiously-associated facilities, outnumber legitimate clinics in Massachusetts by more than two to one.

Anti-abortion centers engage in deceptive advertising practices to lure pregnant people into their clinics. They then provide patients with medical disinformation to dissuade them from accessing abortion care — [~putting patient lives at serious risk~](https://www.masslive.com/worcester/2024/02/worcester-womans-lawsuit-against-clearway-clinic-can-go-forward-report-says.html). 

Most often, anti-abortion centers [~deliberately target~](https://www.kqed.org/news/11937191/abortion-crisis-pregnancy-centers-reproductive-rights-california-roe-v-wade) low-income people, communities of color, or non-English speaking communities with deceptive advertising and the promise of “free resources.”

I was on Moody Street in Waltham, picking up a few things. As I was getting ready to leave my street parking spot, this unexpected interaction occurred.

As I'm checking my mirrors to pull out, a woman steps up in front of my car, gesturing like she's helping me navigate out of the spot. I appreciated the gesture, so I rolled down my window to thank her, but what I heard instead left me stunned. """"He’s \*\*\*\*ing Chinese and he doesn’t know how to ••••ing drive,"""" she said.

I've been living in the Boston area for about seven years now, and it's been a place of warmth and welcoming people. This is the first time I've encountered something so blatantly offensive. I didn't engage or argue much; I just drove away. It felt pointless to escalate the situation.

I managed to capture the whole thing on my dashcam (yeah, those things are lifesavers). Here are the links to the videos:

* Dashcam video #1: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IgbeidBRmgQ](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IgbeidBRmgQ)
* Dashcam video #2: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YX7ApfUMdcg](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YX7ApfUMdcg)

Despite knowing it's not worth dwelling on, I can't shake off the feeling it left me with, especially after an already hectic weekend. Just needed to vent a bit and share it here.

What do you guys think one should react to this kind of situation? Opinions are welcomed.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Hey Reddit family, wow—thanks for all the comments. I was blown away by the number of responses and truly value each of your thoughts and support regarding the situation. I've read through every comment and tried to reply to many, but it turns out I need a bit more comment karma for my responses to be visible to everyone. So, I'm sharing an update here to address some of the recurring points and questions.

**What's the goal of sharing this?** I shared my experience because it's been frustrating, especially since almost everyone I've met in the Boston area, regardless of race, has been kind to me. I believe that, regardless of our political beliefs, we should unite against such negative behaviors.

**Did I hit anything or the car behind when backing out?** No, I didn't, but I understand the confusion due to the noise in the video. That was just my car's noisy brakes. If you listen closely, you'll notice the same sound several times throughout the footage. I’m also posting unedited videos for full clarity:

Unedited version:

* [Part 1](https://youtu.be/UoM3zyiBTn4?si=aApfAm92MxhP9z1F)
* [Part 2](https://youtu.be/2r9EpIHqfwc?si=tqFUvGD5mZABqwDg)

The videos are in two parts because that’s how my dash-cam records, but rest assured, there's an overlap, so nothing was missed.

**Was the person just angry or drunk?** It might seem like she was drunk, but there was no reason for her anger. I didn’t block traffic or hit anything, and I even tried to be appreciative of her “help.” But using drunkenness as an excuse doesn’t justify racist remarks.

**Misidentification in the video?** I had my window down, attempting to thank her, and when she turned, it was clear she was the one. The person who yelled “ya got plenty of space” was someone else.

**Why didn't I retaliate?** Although I was furious and shocked, I believed that escalating the situation would be pointless. Resorting to insults wouldn’t have made me any better. It’s not about fear; it’s about choosing not to stoop to their level. I prefer to stand my ground by raising awareness of what happened.

**Should I expose her on social media?** I’m torn about it. Part of me feels she deserves the consequences of her actions, but I also don’t want to ruin someone's life over this. I aim for accountability, not destruction.

I hope these responses clarify things a bit more. Thanks again for your support and understanding.","Hey mass friend, just want to share something that happen to me today and hope this doesn't happen to anymore people.

Here be the link to the video: * Dashcam video # 1: [ https: / / www. youtube. com / short / IgbeidBRmgQ ] ( https: / / www. youtube. com / short / IgbeidBRmgQ ) * Dashcam video # 2: [ https: / / www. youtube. com / short / YX7ApfUMdcg ] ( https: / / www. youtube. com / short / YX7ApfUMdcg ) Despite know it's not worth dwell on, I can't shake off the feel it leave me with, especially after a already hectic weekend. Just need to vent a bite and share it here. What do you guy think one should react to this kind of situation? opinion be welcome. & # x200B; Edit: Hey Reddit family, wow — thank for all the comment. I be blow away by the numb of response and truly value each of your thought and support regard the situation. I've read through every comment and try to reply to many, but it turn out I need a bite much comment karma for my response to be visible to everyone. So, I'm share a update here to address some of the recur point and question. * * What's the goal of share this? * * I share my experience because it's be frustrate, especially since almost everyone I've meet in the Boston area, regardless of race, have be kind to me. I believe that, regardless of our political belief, we should unite against such negative behavior. * * do I hit anything or the car behind when back out? * * No, I didn't, but I understand the confusion due to the noise in the video. That be just my car's noisy brake. If you listen closely, you'll notice the same sound several time throughout the footage. I ’ be also post unedited video for full clarity: Unedited version: * [ Part 1 ] ( https: / / youtu. be / UoM3zyiBTn4? si=aApfAm92MxhP9z1F ) * [ Part 2 ] ( https: / / youtu. be / 2r9EpIHqfwc? si=tqFUvGD5mZABqwDg ) The video be in two part because that ’ s how my dash - cam record, but rest assure, there's a overlap, so nothing be miss. * * be the person just angry or drink? * * It may seem like she be drink, but there be no reason for her anger. I didn ’ t block traffic or hit anything, and I even try to be appreciative of her “ help. ” But use drunkenness as a excuse doesn ’ t justify racist remark. * * Misidentification in the video? * * I have my window down, attempt to thank her, and when she turn, it be clear she be the one. The person who yell “ you get plenty of space ” be someone else. * * Why didn't I retaliate? * * Although I be furious and shock, I believe that escalate the situation would be pointless. resort to insult wouldn ’ t have make me any good. It ’ s not about fear; it ’ s about choose not to stoop to their level. I prefer to stand my grind by raise awareness of what happen. * * Should I expose her on social medium? * * I ’ be tear about it. Part of me feel she deserve the consequence of her action, but I also don ’ t want to ruin someone's life over this. I aim for accountability, not destruction. I hope this response clarify thing a bite much. thank again for your support and understand.","Massachusetts","I have never had racist comments on me in Boston area, until today","I have never have racist comment on me in Boston area, until today","Culture and Recreation","2024-11-19T01:07:20.465298Z","https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1bhf1dv/i_have_never_had_racist_comments_on_me_in_boston/"

It’s just a great place to chill where you don’t feel pressured to buy more or get out the door.

The food is great too. It’s consistently above average and with sizable portions too. Great deals especially during games and throughout the week. 

The drinks are cheap which is nice because it feels like everything costs $14 these days. The angry orchard with the cinnamon sugar rim is the perfect Fall drink btw.

I thought I’d write here to discuss this season of the King Richard’s Faire in Carver, MA. Not seeing any recent posts as of yet, even though it’s early (started weekend of Aug 31). I do enjoy helping others with deciding if they’d like to attend a place or event with some personal experience. Reddit is usually more helpful than Google in my opinion. 

For further discussions also follow r/renfaire

I understand there’s been countless bad things lately about the Faire, but there are others still attending. 

Let’s start off with the pricing. IT’S CASH ONLY ADMISSION. It was foolish of me not to look into this further before I went this year. Not sure if it’s always been this way, apparently it is though. This also applies to food and drink as well. 

To enter is going to be $46 dollars for adults and $26 for children under 12. That means if you don’t bring cash, you’re forking over $3.50 for an ATM fee on top of that. I posted a photo of one of the food menus for an example. Hopefully this can sort of help you decide what you’ll need for food and drink tickets. 

Once in, you’ll find the food and drink ticket exchange booths. The food and drink ticket booths have approximately two locations on the grounds. Obviously they’re going to upsell you, so that’s why I mentioned prices of the food. Maybe get an idea of what you personally need for food and drink and then you can exchange for more tickets later if need be. 

Alcohol was about $10-$16 depending on the drink. There are about 3 or 4 liquor/beer/wine tables and a few wine only tables throughout. There were a fair amount of choices between cocktails, beer and wine. 

Otherwise, grab a schedule when you enter to see what the days happenings are. We caught the jousting competition and a few different juggling acts. We walked around the faire and went in all the different shops to see what they had to offer. It was a fun time. 

Thank you for reading, hopefully more people can add to this as time goes on. ","Hey all, I think I ’ have write here to discuss this season of the King Richard ’ s Faire in Carver, MA.

Just my understanding of the facts and process behind rates, and I will try to limit opining too much.

In this post, I'll go over:

* Why are supply charges so high?
* Why are delivery charges so high?
* Why are Eversource and National Grid so much more expensive than municipal light plants?
* So what can we do about it?

In full disclosure, I spent almost a decade working in energy consulting with utilities and governments (though never worked at a utility).

**TLDR: It's complicated (but of course, this is Mass), and there is not one single reason why Massachusetts electricity costs are among the highest in the country. A lot of little things add up to something substantial, and the context, constraints, and regulation that Eversource and National Grid operate under are very different than those faced by municipal utilities.**

**One thing that is important to note, however, is that Eversource and National Grid aren't allowed to just make wild profits: everything is regulated by the DPU through rate cases or through program filings designed to meet Massachusetts' climate and energy goals.

# What are all of these charges on my bill?

Electricity bills have two components: **supply** and **delivery**. **Supply** charges are the cost of the electricity. When you are on basic service, you can choose to have your rates change by month or every 6 months. **Electric utilities are not allowed to profit on electricity supply** as a result of the electric sector restructuring from 1997. You're paying the same price Eversource/National Grid pays when you're on their basic service rate.

We also have a deregulated supply market, so you can *potentially* save money with a third-party supplier. This can be challenging with competitive suppliers: while sometimes they offer promo rates for the first year (increasing thereafter), they can be very predatory, targeting low-income residents with lower English language proficiency. Some have cancellation fees and jump to higher rates in the long run if you're not able to jump around on promo rates (like Comcast except you do actually have choice).

The [AG's office has issued a report](https://www.mass.gov/news/new-report-massachusetts-residents-lost-over-577-million-through-competitive-electric-supply-contracts-in-the-last-8-years) every few years on their overcharging in their capacity as the ratepayer advocate for Massachusetts residents and estimates customers on competitive supply paid **nearly $600 million in excess of basic service from 2015-2023**. Ultimately these folks need to extract profit somewhere that Eversource/NGrid are not allowed to and rely on locking people into more expensive rates to cover the cost of offering promo rates. The Senate (endorsed by the AGO and City of Boston) passed a bill to ban competitive suppliers from signing new contracts in the residential market as a result, though the House prefers an approach with higher regulation (and banning them from selling to low-income customers).

Alternatively you may live in a community that has a [municipal aggregation program](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/municipal-aggregation) where your municipality procures electricity supply on behalf of the entire municipality, typically on 2-3 year terms. [Most municipalities have municipal aggregation programs](https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/aggregation) (often with options to buy more renewable generation), and I personally saved hundreds of dollars on my muni aggregation during the 2022-23 spike even with paying a premium for the 100% renewables option.

**Delivery** charges are broken down into several components (numbers from Eversource bill from Eastern MA as a point of reference):

* **Customer charge** ($10/meter): Flat charge per meter that aims to account for the fixed cost of providing service to each customer.
* **Distribution** ($0.094/kWh)**:** This is the cost of bringing power from the transmission substation to end users and includes the cost of financing all of the local infrastructure investments needed, from substation upgrades to new powerlines to enabling more renewables to be connected to the distribution network.
* **Transmission** ($0.041/kWh): This is the cost of maintaining and operating the regional grid and bringing power into the local distribution system.
* **Transition** (minimal and fluctuates): During the restructuring legislation where the utilities had to spin off their owned generation assets, they were given a charge to cover the cost of those stranded assets as a result of the legislation.
* **Revenue decoupling** (fluctuates): I will explain this further below, but the idea is that this is a charge the trues up for the utility the difference between their approved revenue requirement and what is actually collected (and it's also going away).
* **Energy Efficiency** ($0.031/kWh): This is the cost of Mass Save.
* **Distributed Solar** ($0.008/kWh): This is the cost of the MA Solar incentive program SMART.
* **Renewable Energy** ($0.005/kWh): This goes to the Renewable Energy Trust Fund that pays for the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center's programs.
* **Electric Vehicle Program** ($0.001/kWh): This is the cost of the EV make-ready program that provides rebates for EV chargers.

# Why are supply charges so high?

Massachusetts electricity generation is highly dependent on gas (over 70%). However, we also lack pipeline capacity to bring more gas into the region and rely on a liquefied natural gas tanker to bring gas into the system through the terminal in Everett. In fact, Mass received 99% of the nation's LNG imports in 2021 and 82% in 2022.

(Fun fact: This LNG is all imported from overseas: there are no LNG tankers that comply with the Jones Act, an over 100-year old protectionist law that requires all ships that move goods from one US port to another be US-owned, crewed, built, and registered. This means that even though ports from other parts of the country are exporting record amounts of LNG overseas, none of it can come to us!)

Because of this very high dependence on gas + our colder winters (relative to the country, not to New England, but we also have the [highest % of homes that use gas for heat than all other states in New England after RI](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2022.B25040?t=Heating%20and%20Air%20Conditioning%20(HVAC)&g=040XX00US09,23,25,33,44,50)), Massachusetts' electricity supply has the weird feature of being more expensive in the winter than in the summer even though the electricity system peak is in the summer. Nearly every other state is the other way around matching the peak.

When it's unusually cold, heating usage for gas takes priority over electricity generation, which limits availability of gas for power plants (driving up costs). Almost all gas power plants in Mass can then switch to burning oil to continue producing power, but oil is more expensive for power generation than gas. During the February 2023 cold snap where it hit negative temperatures in Boston, spot prices for electricity in the region exceeded $0.50/kWh (for just the supply!).

Dependence on gas leaves us highly vulnerable to market volatility (see Winter 2022-23), which should be improved as offshore wind and more solar come online. The final approval of the transmission line project to bring generation down from Hydro Quebec last year should also help eventually improve stability and put further downward pressure on rates.

# How are delivery charges so high? Who gets to decide these exorbitant rates?

**Transmission** charges are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, because transmission assets and grid management are by their nature interstate, and the federal government has jurisdiction over interstate commerce.

**All other delivery charges are regulated by the Department of Public Utilities and/or were mandated by the Legislature.** Every 5 years, the investor owned utilities file a rate case before the DPU, which involves thousands of documents, spreadsheets, witness testimony, etc. over what is typically at year+ long process (the DPU's order itself is usually [500-800 pages](https://www.eversource.com/content/docs/default-source/investors/nstar-electric-dpu-22-22-final-order-11-30-22.pdf?sfvrsn=c5739f9e_1)...). The DPU adjudicates and takes into account intervening testimony and arguments from parties like the Attorney General's office (in its capacity as the Ratepayer Advocate), the Department of Energy Resources, and advocacy and other groups (like Cape Light Compact, CLF, Acadia Center, and other affected businesses). As you might expect, the utilities aim high and the intervenors and regulators typically push them down.

How are these charges set? Let's separate out what we can call """"cost of service"""" charges and """"policy"""" charges.

**Policy charges** are straightforward: these are the costs of implementing ratepayer-funded energy mandated by legislation supporting achieving Massachusetts' clean energy and climate mitigation goals. As noted above, this includes Mass Save, the SMART solar incentive, the EV Make Ready program, etc. Most of them are fairly small, but they add up to about 20% of the delivery charge. **Utilities cannot profit off of program implementation in service of public policy**. Typically when the DPU approves a ratepayer funded program and its budget, they even will specify the amount that can be spent on administrative costs. All of these programs are paid for solely by the ratepayers.

**Cost of service charges** are more complex and are the primary substance of the rate cases. This all starts (traditionally--there's a new paradigm called performance-based ratemaking that I won't go into here because this essay is long enough already...) with:

* **The revenue requirement:** The utility establishes how much revenue it needs to deliver service (includes O&M, depreciation and amortization, taxes, return on rate base). DPU scrutinizes this and makes adjustments as part of their rate case.
* **Revenue decoupling:** Since 2008, there has been a policy called revenue decoupling where sales are """"decoupled"""" from the revenue requirement established. Represented by the charge on your bill, this is meant to be a reconciling mechanism between expected and actual sales to avoid a disincentive for utilities to encourage energy efficiency and renewables. (This is on its way out because with the growing focus on electrification, there no longer needs to be a means for utilities to avoid not meeting their revenue requirement from declining sales from energy efficiency and solar.)
* **The cost of capital/rate of return:** The utilities are private corporations but heavily regulated. They also have to make very long-term, expensive investments that would otherwise be potentially risky to investors putting up the capital. Since there is a public interest in ensuring utilities have access to capital at low rates/low risk, the DPU determines a fixed rate of return they can achieve from their rate base to serve as an ROI for investors. This includes cost of debt and return on equity to shareholders. **In Eversource's most recent rate case, the approved weighted average cost of capital/rate of return to investors was** **7.06%,** divided between debt at 3.93%, preferred stock at 4.56%, and common equity at 9.8%. That's more than the cost of issuing municipal bonds, but we're not talking Apple or NVIDIA profit margins here.

This is all to say that we have a complex, highly-regulated process behind how delivery charges are set by regulators. The image people seem to bat around of Eversource execs lining their pockets with excess profits wrung out of Massachusetts residents through exorbitant rates is simply not true. They get to profit, but in a fixed, limited way that keeps capital available from investors to be directed into infrastructure. *(Don't point me to National Grid's numbers because the vast majority of NGrid's revenue and profit comes from operating much of the electric and gas grid in the UK).*

The only other way outside of the performance-based ratemaking structure in which the utilities can earn additional profits is through successfully achieving its goals through Mass Save for promoting energy efficiency and electrification. From 2022-2024, the performance incentive available was $150 million (though DPU reduced it by 10% because the utilities dragged their feet during the regulatory process).

**But why is it so expensive?** Well the policy charges are one thing and they add up. In total, it's close to 3.5 cents/kWh. It's like 10% of your bill now but not nothing. Massachusetts' [nation-leading](https://database.aceee.org/state-scorecard-rank) energy efficiency programs don't come free.

Another thing to consider is that a lot of the costs to run a distribution grid are fixed. Infrastructure costs are hard costs that are spread across the rate base. Massachusetts has something like the 4th or 5th lowest electricity usage per capita in the country, so those costs are spread across less usage than a state like Florida, which has more than double the per capita usage.

# Why are investor-owned utilities so much more expensive than municipal utilities?

Well the obvious first answer is profit. But as we've seen above, the rate of return is not by itself the explanation (and municipal utilities themselves have costs of capital as well and need to issue tax-exempt bonds to finance the high capital costs of infrastructure, albeit at a lower cost).

Another contributing factor is taxes (which are included in the revenue requirement). Municipal utilities and all of their assets are tax free, whereas Eversource apparently paid $62 million in taxes in 2014 (2% of the City's budget).

One of the biggest factors, which I'll break down in further detail, is regulatory: municipal utilities are basically never subject to any regulations the state passes on the electricity system and supply (and compliance always adds to costs).

But let's once again look at the two types of charges: supply and delivery. The reasons, as you will see, are primarily related to policy and regulation (or rather, deregulation).

**Supply charges:** Unlike Eversource/NGrid who had to spin off their assets and purchase power on the open market to pass onto their customers at cost, municipal light plants were not subject to the electricity deregulation legislation from 1997. Many municipal light plants purchase their power through [MMWEC](https://www.mmwec.org/) which IS allowed to own assets. In fact, it owns 12% of the Seabrook nuclear plant and 5% of Millstone Unit 3 nuclear plant. It also has the rights to about 4% of the Hydro-Quebec Interconnection and a few other long-term hydro contracts.

In total this means that a lot of municipal light plants have roughly 50% of their generation coming from long-term, more stably-priced contracts (with the rest coming from the wholesale market), most of which is zero-emissions generation (mostly from the nuclear). And since MMWEC and its members are obligated to deliver the cheapest power possible, they will never allow their lower power capacity onto the open market, which forces Eversource and NGrid to buy high-priced fossil fuel generation from the wholesale market. This really came to a head in Winter 2022-23 when the impacts of the Russian invasion + high inflation drove basic service rates to record highs on the wholesale market but had a much more limited impact for municipal utilities. Since most muni utilities are smaller towns, their peaks in usage are also much lower, meaning less buying of power on the spot market when it's at its most expensive.

One of those regulations I mentioned that municipal utilities are not subject to is the increasing requirements for renewable electricity generation under the state's Clean Energy and Renewable Portfolio Standards. While municipal utility electricity is lower-emissions because of nuclear/hydro, municipal utilities are not required by law to source increasing amounts of their electricity from *new* solar and wind resources. This cost of compliance can add fairly significantly to the cost of energy supply--and when Eversource/NGrid fail to source enough electricity from new solar and wind resources, they have to pay a penalty (Alternative Compliance Payment).

Not having to source increasing amounts of NEW renewable electricity generation like Eversource/NGrid and their suppliers have to helps them to keep costs down and limit the amount of the cost of the state's renewable electricity policies get passed onto their customers. That is not to say that municipal utilities are not contributing to new renewables (e.g. Berkshire Wind Power Cooperative), but they don't have an aggressive state policy impacting their supply rates in the same way.

**Delivery charges:** Once again, let's separate out policy charges and cost of service charges:

* **Policy charges:** That $0.035/kWh I mentioned earlier for Mass Save, solar programs, EV make ready programs, and more? They exist in very limited fashion in most municipal utilities. The money that pays for 75% of insulation upgrades, $10,000 for heat pumps, 0% loans to finance Mass Save projects, annual incentive payments for solar generation, retail rate compensation through net metering for solar? That comes from these charges that municipal utilities by and large do not include. Consequently, incentives are also much more limited. Some municipal utilities choose to try to come closer to matching Mass Save (and have higher costs). But Mass Save is state mandated and only for Eversource and NGrid, and the legislatively-mandated savings Mass Save has to achieve keep increasing, as does the charge.
* **Other policy-driven charges that show up in the distribution charge:** This includes things like grid modernization planning and investments (see the recently-approved [Electric Sector Modernization Plans](https://www.mass.gov/news/dpu-approves-plans-to-modernize-electric-sector-to-accelerate-clean-energy-transition), which authorizes billions in new spending). Also things like how Eversource and NGrid must provide discounted electricity rates to low-income customers, which are then spread out across all other customers. Municipal utilities don't have to do these things so often don't choose to, keeping their overall rates lower.
* **Infrastructure and operational complexity:** I'm just gonna paste in something from a post by /u/An_Awesome_Name here since they explained it very well: """"*Outside of NYC, and maybe a few other places, the grid in the immediate vicinity of Boston (say inside of 128) is one of the highest electrical load areas per square mile in the entire world on a hot summer afternoon. Air conditioners, trains, high-rise buildings, universities, hospital campuses, and general industry all suck down huge amounts of power compared to residential and light commercial areas, and we have a lot of all of them. It may sound counter-intuitive because everything is close together, but the higher the capacity of a power line, the more expensive it is to build and maintain, especially when lots of them are underground. The maintenance required just to a keep a power grid this complex operational is going to be more expensive than above ground, low capacity lines in most of the rest of the country.*"""" A small, mostly bed-room community outside of the urban core with all lines overhead is simply going to be cheaper to maintain than the core Boston grid. Rates for ConEd in NYC compared to National Grid in upstate NY reflect this, even though both are for-profit investor-owned utilities regulated by the NY DPS.

# So what can we do about it?

As I mentioned earlier, on the supply front, one of the best things we can do is keep enabling more offshore wind to come online, which reduces our dependence on volatile gas generation. Similarly, the hydro coming down from Quebec that hopefully will come online in a few years will also add a stabilizing, lower cost source of power. If we can cut out most of the LNG deliveries alone, that could be quite beneficial.

On the distribution side? Well, that's complicated, and there aren't really clear answers here.

* **Stop trying to hit our climate change targets?** I'm not here to debate the merits of the Commonwealth's goals to achieve 85% greenhouse gas emissions reductions by 2050, but it is a fact that it has costs and implications for system planning, in addition to the benefits. All those incentive programs don't come cheap. Additionally, there are significant costs to the new infrastructure needed to integrate new renewables and serve increasing electricity loads as we grow as a state + get more EVs on the road and heat pumps installed (dozens of new substations needed for solar, offshore wind, batteries, more electricity demand). We need to switch from a centralized system with big power plants to a decentralized system with many renewable generators. That takes major investments. We're also likely to switch to a winter-peaking system by the mid-2030s if we are on target for our climate goals, and that will put us into new territory.
* **More gas infrastructure?** Some might say """"well let a new gas pipeline be built so we can get more gas into the state,"""" but it's not all that simple. For one, our neighboring states also have climate goals and don't want to bring in new gas pipelines, so where are we going to put it? Additionally, if Massachusetts is committed to weaning itself off of gas to meet climate goals, how do we pay for the pipeline? Most gas infrastructure is depreciated over a 50 year lifetime, but we'd have to accelerate the depreciation if we are serious about being mostly off of gas by 2050. A very expensive band-aid and another stranded asset if we're serious about hitting our goals. Considering how long it's taken to get the Hydro Quebec transmission line through planning and into construction, it would probably be 5-10 years if we started trying to build a new pipeline from PA to here today.
* **Re-regulate the utilities?** The impacts of the electric sector deregulation from 1997 are complex and fuzzy. The one thing we know we can say about deregulation is that it shifted all of the profit-making for a for-profit industry to just delivering electricity. By restricting these utilities to only profiting from infrastructure and power delivery, private utilities are incentivized to make more infrastructure investments (that they profit from). Does this lead to utilities putting infrastructure-first over other alternatives? Probably. It's also likely that the move from vertically-integrated utilities to distribution utilities with no control over generation assets has increased costs and limited the scope of planning (something municipal utilities also can do). Additionally, there is an interesting [working paper](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/21-095_ba6594bd-2648-4069-94bb-52dfd9495fb1.pdf) that argues that market hurdles to participate in the deregulated market and market dynamics increases profit margin for generators and cost of power to utilities even when generation costs are lower to power producers as a result of deregulation. Would re-regulating help? I really don't know.
* **Public utilities all around?** Would allowing for more municipal light plants or having the state take over the grid help? I don't know. It probably would have some growing pains as you'd have municipalities with no experience delivering a utility service having to staff up to run one. Would it be faster and more nimble? Proooobably not. But would it reduce costs in the long term (after factoring in the borrowing cost to buy tens of billions of dollars of assets)? I don't have an answer for that.

What can you do about it personally?

* **Mass Save:** If you own your home, take advantage of it. There are [a LOT of rebates available](https://www.masssave.com/en/residential/rebates-and-incentives), and you can get a [0% loan](https://www.masssave.com/en/residential/programs-and-services/financing) of up to $25,000 ($50k if it includes a heat pump) over 7 years from your choice of local bank/credit union. If you make <60% of the state median income and are a renter and you have a landlord that will actually pick up the phone/answer emails, [Mass Save delivers all of its services for free](https://www.masssave.com/en/residential/programs-and-services/income-based-offers) depending on your building. It's not a perfect program (what bureaucratic $4 billion program is?), but you're already paying for it. Might as well get your money's worth.
* **Solar:** Again, if you own your own home, you're paying for the [SMART solar program](https://masmartsolar.com/). Take advantage of it. Retail rate net metering (what lets you get a 1 for 1 credit on your bill for excess generation) is probably not going to last forever in its current form. The incentive program is currently being revamped and extended, as it has expired for some areas in Mass.
* **Municipal aggregation:** Look into your community's [municipal aggregation program](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/municipal-aggregation) and see if it could be right for you (or advocate for one if you live in a community that doesn't have one and isn't served by a municipal utility). Residents are opted into it when it's set up by default unless they're on a third party supply contract. Municipal contracts are not guaranteed to be cheaper than basic service, but they have [on average saved money compared to basic service over the past several years](https://blog.greenenergyconsumers.org/blog/new-report-gma-continues-to-be-a-success-in-the-bay-state).
* **Competitive third-party supply:** See what I said earlier, and buyer beware. On average, [people across the state are not saving money third-party suppliers](https://www.mass.gov/news/new-report-massachusetts-residents-lost-over-577-million-through-competitive-electric-supply-contracts-in-the-last-8-years). If you think you can be in the minority, [best of luck to you](https://energyswitchma.gov/). But make sure you read up on what happens to your rate after the initial term, and beware of cancellation fees.

If you made it this far, hopefully this helped answer any questions you had (or maybe just created more frustrations at the size of your bill).

The [ AG's office have issue a report ] ( https: / / www. mass. gov / news / new - report - massachusetts - resident - lose - over - 577 - million - through - competitive - electric - supply - contract - in - the - last - 8 - year ) every few year on their overcharge in their capacity as the ratepayer advocate for Massachusetts resident and estimate customer on competitive supply pay * * nearly $600 million in excess of basic service from 2015 - 2023 * *. Ultimately this folk need to extract profit somewhere that Eversource / NGrid be not allow to and rely on lock people into much expensive rate to cover the cost of offer promo rate. The Senate ( endorse by the AGO and City of Boston ) pass a bill to ban competitive supplier from sign new contract in the residential market as a result, though the House prefer a approach with high regulation ( and ban them from sell to low - income customer ). Alternatively you may live in a community that have a [ municipal aggregation program ] ( https: / / www. mass. gov / info - detail / municipal - aggregation ) where your municipality procure electricity supply on behalf of the entire municipality, typically on 2 - 3 year term. [ much municipality have municipal aggregation program ] ( https: / / www. greenenergyconsumers. org / aggregation ) ( often with option to buy much renewable generation ), and I personally save hundred of dollar on my muni aggregation during the 2022 - 23 spike even with pay a premium for the 100 % renewable option. * * Delivery * * charge be break down into several component ( number from Eversource bill from Eastern MA as a point of reference ): * * * Customer charge * * ( $10 / meter ): Flat charge per meter that aim to account for the fix cost of provide service to each customer. * * * Distribution * * ( $0. 094 / kWh ) * *: * * This be the cost of bring power from the transmission substation to end user and include the cost of finance all of the local infrastructure investment need, from substation upgrade to new powerlines to enable much renewable to be connect to the distribution network. * * * Transmission * * ( $0. 041 / kWh ): This be the cost of maintain and operate the regional grid and bring power into the local distribution system. * * * Transition * * ( minimal and fluctuate ): During the restructure legislation where the utility have to spin off their own generation asset, they be give a charge to cover the cost of that strand asset as a result of the legislation. * * * Revenue decouple * * ( fluctuate ): I will explain this far below, but the idea be that this be a charge the trues up for the utility the difference between their approve revenue requirement and what be actually collect ( and it's also go away ). * * * Energy Efficiency * * ( $0. 031 / kWh ): This be the cost of Mass Save. * * * distribute Solar * * ( $0. 008 / kWh ): This be the cost of the MA Solar incentive program SMART. * * * Renewable Energy * * ( $0. 005 / kWh ): This go to the Renewable Energy Trust Fund that pay for the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center's program. * * * Electric Vehicle Program * * ( $0. 001 / kWh ): This be the cost of the EV make - ready program that provide rebate for EV charger. # Why be supply charge so high? Massachusetts electricity generation be highly dependent on gas ( over 70 % ). However, we also lack pipeline capacity to bring much gas into the region and rely on a liquefy natural gas tanker to bring gas into the system through the terminal in Everett. In fact, Mass receive 99 % of the nation's LNG import in 2021 and 82 % in 2022. ( Fun fact: This LNG be all import from overseas: there be no LNG tanker that comply with the Jones Act, a over 100 - year old protectionist law that require all ship that move good from one US port to another be US - own, crew, build, and register. This mean that even though port from other part of the country be export record amount of LNG overseas, none of it can come to us! ) Because of this very high dependence on gas + our cold winter ( relative to the country, not to New England, but we also have the [ high % of home that use gas for heat than all other state in New England after RI ] ( https: / / datum. census. gov / table / ACSDT1Y2022. B25040? t=Heating % 20and % 20Air % 20Conditioning % 20 ( HVAC ) & g=040XX00US09, 23, 25, 33, 44, 50 ) ), Massachusetts' electricity supply have the weird feature of be much expensive in the winter than in the summer even though the electricity system peak be in the summer. Nearly every other state be the other way around match the peak. When it's unusually cold, heat usage for gas take priority over electricity generation, which limit availability of gas for power plant ( drive up cost ). Almost all gas power plant in Mass can then switch to burn oil to continue produce power, but oil be much expensive for power generation than gas. During the February 2023 cold snap where it hit negative temperature in Boston, spot price for electricity in the region exceed $0.50 / kWh ( for just the supply! ). Dependence on gas leave us highly vulnerable to market volatility ( see Winter 2022 - 23 ), which should be improve as offshore wind and much solar come online. The final approval of the transmission line project to bring generation down from Hydro Quebec last year should also help eventually improve stability and put far downward pressure on rate. # How be delivery charge so high? Who get to decide this exorbitant rate? * * Transmission * * charge be regulate by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, because transmission asset and grid management be by their nature interstate, and the federal government have jurisdiction over interstate commerce. * * All other delivery charge be regulate by the Department of Public utility and / or be mandate by the Legislature. * * Every 5 year, the investor own utility file a rate case before the DPU, which involve thousand of document, spreadsheet, witness testimony, etc. over what be typically at year+ long process ( the DPU's order itself be usually [ 500 - 800 page ] ( https: / / www. eversource. com / content / doc / default - source / investor / nstar - electric - dpu - 22 - 22 - final - order - 11 - 30 - 22. pdf? sfvrsn=c5739f9e _ 1 )... ). The DPU adjudicate and take into account intervene testimony and argument from party like the Attorney General's office ( in its capacity as the Ratepayer Advocate ), the Department of Energy resource, and advocacy and other group ( like Cape Light Compact, CLF, Acadia Center, and other affect business ). As you may expect, the utility aim high and the intervenors and regulator typically push them down. How be this charge set? Let's separate out what we can call "" "" cost of service "" "" charge and "" "" policy "" "" charge. * * Policy charge * * be straightforward: this be the cost of implement ratepayer - fund energy mandate by legislation support achieve Massachusetts' clean energy and climate mitigation goal. As note above, this include Mass Save, the SMART solar incentive, the EV Make Ready program, etc. much of them be fairly small, but they add up to about 20 % of the delivery charge. * * utility cannot profit off of program implementation in service of public policy * *. Typically when the DPU approve a ratepayer fund program and its budget, they even will specify the amount that can be spend on administrative cost. All of this program be pay for solely by the ratepayer. * * Cost of service charge * * be much complex and be the primary substance of the rate case. This all start ( traditionally - - there's a new paradigm call performance - base ratemaking that I won't go into here because this essay be long enough already... ) with: * * * The revenue requirement: * * The utility establish how much revenue it need to deliver service ( include O & be, depreciation and amortization, tax, return on rate base ). DPU scrutinize this and make adjustment as part of their rate case. * * * Revenue decouple: * * Since 2008, there have be a policy call revenue decouple where sale be "" "" decouple "" "" from the revenue requirement establish. represent by the charge on your bill, this be mean to be a reconcile mechanism between expect and actual sale to avoid a disincentive for utility to encourage energy efficiency and renewable. ( This be on its way out because with the grow focus on electrification, there no long need to be a mean for utility to avoid not meet their revenue requirement from decline sale from energy efficiency and solar. ) * * * The cost of capital / rate of return: * * The utility be private corporation but heavily regulate. They also have to make very long - term, expensive investment that would otherwise be potentially risky to investor putting up the capital. Since there be a public interest in ensure utility have access to capital at low rate / low risk, the DPU determine a fix rate of return they can achieve from their rate base to serve as a ROI for investor. This include cost of debt and return on equity to shareholder. * * In Eversource's much recent rate case, the approve weight average cost of capital / rate of return to investor be * * * * 7. 06 %, * * divide between debt at 3.93 %, prefer stock at 4.56 %, and common equity at 9. 8 %. That's much than the cost of issue municipal bond, but we're not talk Apple or NVIDIA profit margin here. This be all to say that we have a complex, highly - regulate process behind how delivery charge be set by regulator. The image people seem to bat around of Eversource execs line their pocket with excess profit wring out of Massachusetts resident through exorbitant rate be simply not true. They get to profit, but in a fix, limit way that keep capital available from investor to be direct into infrastructure. * ( Don't point me to National Grid's number because the vast majority of NGrid's revenue and profit come from operate much of the electric and gas grid in the UK ). * The only other way outside of the performance - base ratemaking structure in which the utility can earn additional profit be through successfully achieve its goal through Mass Save for promote energy efficiency and electrification. From 2022 - 2024, the performance incentive available be $150 million ( though DPU reduce it by 10 % because the utility drag their foot during the regulatory process ). * * But why be it so expensive? * * good the policy charge be one thing and they add up. In total, it's close to 3.5 cent / kWh. It's like 10 % of your bill now but not nothing. Massachusetts' [ nation - lead ] ( https: / / database. aceee. org / state - scorecard - rank ) energy efficiency program don't come free. Another thing to consider be that a lot of the cost to run a distribution grid be fix. Infrastructure cost be hard cost that be spread across the rate base. Massachusetts have something like the 4th or 5th low electricity usage per caput in the country, so that cost be spread across little usage than a state like Florida, which have much than double the per caput usage. # Why be investor - own utility so much much expensive than municipal utility? good the obvious first answer be profit. But as we've see above, the rate of return be not by itself the explanation ( and municipal utility themselves have cost of capital as good and need to issue tax - exempt bond to finance the high capital cost of infrastructure, albeit at a low cost ). Another contribute factor be tax ( which be include in the revenue requirement ). Municipal utility and all of their asset be tax free, whereas Eversource apparently pay $62 million in tax in 2014 ( 2 % of the City's budget ). One of the big factor, which I'll break down in far detail, be regulatory: municipal utility be basically never subject to any regulation the state pass on the electricity system and supply ( and compliance always add to cost ). But let's once again look at the two type of charge: supply and delivery. The reason, as you will see, be primarily relate to policy and regulation ( or rather, deregulation ). * * Supply charge: * * Unlike Eversource / NGrid who have to spin off their asset and purchase power on the open market to pass onto their customer at cost, municipal light plant be not subject to the electricity deregulation legislation from 1997. Many municipal light plant purchase their power through [ MMWEC ] ( https: / / www. mmwec. org / ) which be allow to own asset. In fact, it own 12 % of the Seabrook nuclear plant and 5 % of Millstone Unit 3 nuclear plant. It also have the right to about 4 % of the Hydro - Quebec Interconnection and a few other long - term hydro contract. In total this mean that a lot of municipal light plant have roughly 50 % of their generation come from long - term, much stably - price contract ( with the rest come from the wholesale market ), much of which be zero - emission generation ( mostly from the nuclear ). And since MMWEC and its member be obligate to deliver the cheap power possible, they will never allow their low power capacity onto the open market, which force Eversource and NGrid to buy high - price fossil fuel generation from the wholesale market. This really come to a head in Winter 2022 - 23 when the impact of the Russian invasion + high inflation drive basic service rate to record high on the wholesale market but have a much much limit impact for municipal utility. Since much muni utility be small town, their peak in usage be also much low, mean little buy of power on the spot market when it's at its much expensive. One of that regulation I mention that municipal utility be not subject to be the increase requirement for renewable electricity generation under the state's Clean Energy and Renewable Portfolio standard. While municipal utility electricity be low - emission because of nuclear / hydro, municipal utility be not require by law to source increase amount of their electricity from * new * solar and wind resource. This cost of compliance can add fairly significantly to the cost of energy supply - - and when Eversource / NGrid fail to source enough electricity from new solar and wind resource, they have to pay a penalty ( Alternative Compliance Payment ). Not have to source increase amount of NEW renewable electricity generation like Eversource / NGrid and their supplier have to help them to keep cost down and limit the amount of the cost of the state's renewable electricity policy get pass onto their customer. That be not to say that municipal utility be not contribute to new renewable ( e. g. Berkshire Wind Power Cooperative ), but they don't have a aggressive state policy impact their supply rate in the same way. * * Delivery charge: * * Once again, let's separate out policy charge and cost of service charge: * * * Policy charge: * * That $0. 035 / kWh I mention early for Mass Save, solar program, EV make ready program, and much? They exist in very limit fashion in much municipal utility. The money that pay for 75 % of insulation upgrade, $10,000 for heat pump, 0 % loan to finance Mass Save project, annual incentive payment for solar generation, retail rate compensation through net meter for solar? That come from this charge that municipal utility by and large do not include. Consequently, incentive be also much much limit. Some municipal utility choose to try to come close to match Mass Save ( and have high cost ). But Mass Save be state mandate and only for Eversource and NGrid, and the legislatively - mandate saving Mass Save have to achieve keep increase, as do the charge. * * * Other policy - drive charge that show up in the distribution charge: * * This include thing like grid modernization plan and investment ( see the recently - approve [ Electric Sector Modernization plan ] ( https: / / www. mass. gov / news / dpu - approve - plan - to - modernize - electric - sector - to - accelerate - clean - energy - transition ), which authorize billion in new spend ). Also thing like how Eversource and NGrid must provide discount electricity rate to low - income customer, which be then spread out across all other customer. Municipal utility don't have to do this thing so often don't choose to, keep their overall rate low. * * * Infrastructure and operational complexity: * * I'm just gonna paste in something from a post by / u / a _ Awesome _ Name here since they explain it very good: "" "" * Outside of NYC, and maybe a few other place, the grid in the immediate vicinity of Boston ( say inside of 128 ) be one of the high electrical load area per square mile in the entire world on a hot summer afternoon. Air conditioner, train, high - rise building, university, hospital campus, and general industry all suck down huge amount of power compare to residential and light commercial area, and we have a lot of all of them. It may sound counter - intuitive because everything be close together, but the high the capacity of a power line, the much expensive it be to build and maintain, especially when lot of them be underground. The maintenance require just to a keep a power grid this complex operational be go to be much expensive than above grind, low capacity line in much of the rest of the country. * "" "" A small, mostly bed - room community outside of the urban core with all line overhead be simply go to be cheap to maintain than the core Boston grid. rate for cone in NYC compare to National Grid in upstate NY reflect this, even though both be for - profit investor - own utility regulate by the NY DPS. # So what can we do about it? As I mention early, on the supply front, one of the good thing we can do be keep enable much offshore wind to come online, which reduce our dependence on volatile gas generation. Similarly, the hydro come down from Quebec that hopefully will come online in a few year will also add a stabilize, low cost source of power. If we can cut out much of the LNG delivery alone, that can be quite beneficial. On the distribution side? good, that's complicate, and there aren't really clear answer here. * * * Stop try to hit our climate change target? * * I'm not here to debate the merit of the Commonwealth's goal to achieve 85 % greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2050, but it be a fact that it have cost and implication for system plan, in addition to the benefit. All that incentive program don't come cheap. Additionally, there be significant cost to the new infrastructure need to integrate new renewable and serve increase electricity load as we grow as a state + get much ev on the road and heat pump install ( dozen of new substation need for solar, offshore wind, battery, much electricity demand ). We need to switch from a centralize system with big power plant to a decentralize system with many renewable generator. That take major investment. We're also likely to switch to a winter - peak system by the mid - 2030s if we be on target for our climate goal, and that will put us into new territory. * * * much gas infrastructure? * * Some may say "" "" good let a new gas pipeline be build so we can get much gas into the state, "" "" but it's not all that simple. For one, our neighbor state also have climate goal and don't want to bring in new gas pipeline, so where be we go to put it? Additionally, if Massachusetts be commit to wean itself off of gas to meet climate goal, how do we pay for the pipeline? much gas infrastructure be depreciate over a 50 year lifetime, but we'd have to accelerate the depreciation if we be serious about be mostly off of gas by 2050. A very expensive band - aid and another strand asset if we're serious about hit our goal. consider how long it's take to get the Hydro Quebec transmission line through plan and into construction, it would probably be 5-10 year if we start try to build a new pipeline from PA to here today. * * * Re - regulate the utility? * * The impact of the electric sector deregulation from 1997 be complex and fuzzy. The one thing we know we can say about deregulation be that it shift all of the profit - make for a for - profit industry to just deliver electricity. By restrict this utility to only profit from infrastructure and power delivery, private utility be incentivized to make much infrastructure investment ( that they profit from ). do this lead to utility putting infrastructure - first over other alternative? Probably. It's also likely that the move from vertically - integrate utility to distribution utility with no control over generation asset have increase cost and limit the scope of plan ( something municipal utility also can do ). Additionally, there be a interest [ work paper ] ( https: / / www. hbs. edu / ri / Publication % 20Files / 21 - 095 _ ba6594bd - 2648-4069 - 94bb - 52dfd9495fb1. pdf ) that argue that market hurdle to participate in the deregulate market and market dynamic increase profit margin for generator and cost of power to utility even when generation cost be low to power producer as a result of deregulation. Would re - regulate help? I really don't know. * * * Public utility all around? * * Would allow for much municipal light plant or have the state take over the grid help? I don't know. It probably would have some grow pain as you'd have municipality with no experience deliver a utility service have to staff up to run one. Would it be fast and much nimble? Proooobably not. But would it reduce cost in the long term ( after factor in the borrow cost to buy ten of billion of dollar of asset )? I don't have a answer for that. What can you do about it personally? * * * Mass Save: * * If you own your home, take advantage of it. There be [ a LOT of rebate available ] ( https: / / www. masssave. com / en / residential / rebate - and - incentive ), and you can get a [ 0 % loan ] ( https: / / www. masssave. com / en / residential / program - and - service / finance ) of up to $25,000 ( $50k if it include a heat pump ) over 7 year from your choice of local bank / credit union. If you make <60 % of the state median income and be a renter and you have a landlord that will actually pick up the phone / answer email, [ Mass Save deliver all of its service for free ] ( https: / / www. masssave. com / en / residential / program - and - service / income - base - offer ) depend on your build. It's not a perfect program ( what bureaucratic $4 billion program be? ), but you're already pay for it. may as good get your money's worth. * * * Solar: * * Again, if you own your own home, you're pay for the [ SMART solar program ] ( https: / / masmartsolar. com / ). Take advantage of it. Retail rate net meter ( what let you get a 1 for 1 credit on your bill for excess generation ) be probably not go to last forever in its current form. The incentive program be currently be revamp and extend, as it have expire for some area in Mass. * * * Municipal aggregation: * * Look into your community's [ municipal aggregation program ] ( https: / / www. mass. gov / info - detail / municipal - aggregation ) and see if it can be right for you ( or advocate for one if you live in a community that doesn't have one and isn't serve by a municipal utility ). resident be opt into it when it's set up by default unless they're on a 3 party supply contract. Municipal contract be not guarantee to be cheap than basic service, but they have [ on average save money compare to basic service over the past several year ] ( https: / / blog. greenenergyconsumers. org / blog / new - report - gma - continue - to - be - a - success - in - the - bay - state ). * * * Competitive 3 - party supply: * * See what I say early, and buyer beware. On average, [ people across the state be not save money 3 - party supplier ] ( https: / / www. mass. gov / news / new - report - massachusetts - resident - lose - over - 577 - million - through - competitive - electric - supply - contract - in - the - last - 8 - year ).

Driving home on the Pike around 5:30 today, so traffic was dense. Was going to stop for something to eat, so was trying to get over to the right lane to get off at the Framingham rest stop. Didn’t cut anyone off, but with traffic that dense, I had to take what I could get and slipped into a reasonable but fairly tight opening between two cars in the right lane just before the exit.  The car behind made a point of closing the gap on me and getting right up on my bumper. I looked back and he kind of made an annoyed gesture with his hand, but nothing too bad. Whatever, not the last time someone will be annoyed on the Pike and the dude looked like a kind of meatball that probably flicks off 3 drivers on the pike everyday

Anyways, I get off at the rest stop and I see he’s getting off too. I kept my eyes on him just to see if he turned and stop following me. He doesn’t turn for Starbucks. He doesn’t turn into the main parking area. He doesn’t turn to get gas, and he’s still right behind me as we’re to the end of the rest stop at the convenience store, which is weird because like 95% of people head to the gas station or the main parking area. I slow down for a parking space and see he’s turning into the same store. Feeling a little off with the situation and just feeling like something was wrong, I just drive away and get back on the Pike.

As I’m driving towards the Pike, I look back and see he stopped turning into the store and is now heading toward the Pike too. He got on behind me and then flew by me in the left lane and I didn’t see him again.

Dunno, maybe he was just looking to yell because he thought I cut him off or something. But just had this bad feeling as soon as he got off the pike, and he was clearly following me to confront me at the store given the way he followed me all the way to the end and then decided not to stop when he realized I wasn’t stopping. Someone who needs to following someone to a rest stop because they slightly cut in front of them to get off the highway is probably unhinged a bit in general, so no idea where it stopped.","Just need to tell this story as not really sure who else I ’ have tell. drive home on the Pike around 5: 30 today, so traffic be dense. be go to stop for something to eat, so be try to get over to the right lane to get off at the Framingham rest stop.

I’m an EMT in the greater Boston area, and my frustration has reached its peak. When you’re driving and an ambulance is approaching you from behind, pull over AWAY from the ambulance (preferably to the right, sometimes the left if cars around you are making an opening). Please stop driving and speeding up thinking you’re helping us or not obstructing us. When you get to the next red light up ahead, you’re a barrier and become another car that has to move out of our way. The same thing applies on the highway and one way ramps. Pull over the side, there’s generally enough space for both of us. Additionally, do not stop in the middle of the road (or highway) when we are directly behind you… we don’t have wings and we can’t fly (MedFlight can though, but I am not MedFlight). There are some of you who also do not stop at intersections despite a blaring siren coming your way. Find the ambulance or emergency vehicle first before attempting to make your turn. We take due caution to clear intersections, but I can’t clear an intersection if I can’t see you and you pull up from nowhere trying to make the yellow light. Some of you are not only risking your lives but other people’s when you engage in poor driving practices around emergency vehicles (and honestly even in general), please do better. Put a pause on your ego and stop trying to overtake ambulances or prevent us from merging in your lane. It’s not that deep for you. Imagine you were in the back and we missed the exit to the hospital because someone wouldn’t let us merge…

P.S.: if your family member or loved one is in the back with us, do not follow us through red lights. You are bound to red lights and other traffic ordinances, and you are not an emergency vehicle. I’m sure your loved one doesn’t want you in a hospital bed next to them because you were T-boned following us. 

P.P.S: if we have lights and sirens and are driving “slow”, we might be taking extra caution to avoid hitting potholes and bumps on the road. Many trucks feel every pothole and bump, and the technician in the back may be doing something delicate or the patient could be sensitive to movements. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t follow regular policies for emergency response vehicles. If we don’t have lights and sirens, don’t assume we’re not going to or from a call. We don’t always go with our sirens to and from every call, but it doesn’t mean we don’t have anyone in the back. Tailgating me is not going to make me go any faster and risk endangering my patient.

Edit:
TL;DR: pull over to the side when an ambulance is approaching, slow your speed (or stop), and let us pass you—stop jeopardizing lives because your ego can’t handle sick people being prioritized over you.","hello yall, I ’ be a EMT in the great Boston area, and my frustration have reach its peak.

Blistering criticism of a State Police investigator’s crude comments in the Karen Read murder case has a top law enforcement watchdog renewing its demand the governor overhaul the agency — as Facebook users rip into troopers online.

It’s so bad that a forced receivership of the Massachusetts State Police should be considered, “before someone else does it,” said Dennis Galvin, president of the Massachusetts Association for Professional Law Enforcement (MAPLE).

“There are extremely disturbing things coming out of this trial,” Galvin said of the Read case, adding they are “serious professional issues.”

He said his organization is calling on Gov. Maura Healey to immediately establish a blue ribbon commission to investigate the agency. “There needs to be a stem-to-stern review,” Galvin, a retired State Police commander, told the Herald. He was reluctant to speak further while the Read trial enters its 26th day Monday.

Interim State Police Colonel John Mawn said in a rare statement to the Herald Sunday evening that he shares the public’s disgust but must respect “the integrity of the ongoing criminal trial and our own internal affairs investigation.”

Mawn added: “I share the outrage and acknowledge the concern surrounding the contemptible and disparaging text messages that emerged at trial. Any form of police misconduct undermines the public trust we strive to earn to effectively accomplish our mission. Despite the example of honest, hardworking women and men in our ranks, we understand as leaders that more must be done to uphold the highest standards of professionalism.”

The Department of Justice is reportedly investigating the conduct of the Canton and State Police in the Read case.

A six-person search committee is also in the process of interviewing finalists for the next colonel of the State Police, according to the Healey administration.

Yet, the seemingly never-ending loop of misconduct in the State Police, including overtime abuse, drunken driving, bribery allegations, and now misogynist exchanges by an MSP trooper assigned to the Read case are exposing a feared ethical rot in the agency.

State Police Trooper Michael Proctor admitted on the stand last week to “inappropriate” and “regrettable” comments he made in texts to friends and co-workers during his investigation into Read, who is accused of killing Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe two years ago when she allegedly rammed her vehicle into him.

Proctor described Read as a “whack job,” “a babe” who had “no (butt)” and texted his sister that “hopefully (Read) kills herself,” according to evidence presented by Read’s defense lawyers. He also commented to colleagues, “No nudes so far,” when searching her phone mid-probe.

Proctor is also an investigator in the Brian Walshe murder case, where a Cohasset husband is accused of dismembering his wife and scattering her remains all over the North Shore. His trial looms next.

Healey lit up Proctor outside her office last week, saying: “As a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that. I’ll also say that this is the subject of a criminal investigation and trial, and therefore it’s not appropriate for me to speak more to that at this time.”

U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss and others echoed Healey’s caution about commenting while the trial is ongoing.

Norfolk DA Michael Morrissey’s office said the State Police headquarters in Framingham oversees all troopers. Morrissey is also a delegate to this summer’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago Aug. 19-22, with fellow Democrats reluctant to address his status while the Read trial is coming down to the wire.

The exposure of the unprofessional inner-workings of the State Police, however, has hit the agency so hard that furious Bay State residents are turning to MSP social media posts to tear into the agency.

“Hope none of the troopers had the audacity to make fun of his illness,” a commenter said on a Facebook post about a child with a brain tumor allowed to touch MSP trucks at a recent event.

Other comments on the same post included: “You guys are some serious disgraceful thugs” and “Largest gang in Massachusetts.”

Others called for the State Police to “clean house” and “do better.” The troopers were called “brown shirts,” “shameless,” “toxic,” “criminals,” with one Facebook user urging the MSP brass to get rid of the “bad apples” and give the state back its top police unit.

“The MSP does have a chance to redeem itself,” a Facebook user said this weekend, with another saying you just risk being “Proctorized.”

The State Police do use body-worn cameras, as a Facebook user wondered, but it is not clear if Proctor ever had one on while he investigated the Canton murder of a BPD officer.

“This is all going to get worse,” a law enforcement source told the Herald. “Who runs this state?”","https: / / www. sentinelandenterprise. com / 2024 / 06 / 17 / massachusetts - governor - urge - to - overhaul - state - police - after - trooper - vulgar - text - in - karen - read - case - as - facebook - user - rip - agency / blister criticism of a State Police investigator ’ s crude comment in the Karen Read murder case have a top law enforcement watchdog renew its demand the governor overhaul the agency — as Facebook user rip into trooper online.

Given that Walz is the VP candidate for the Democrats and what Trump and Vance have said about Walz, it should not be surprising that if Trump wins, there is a good chance that he will try to direct any kind of federal funding that Minnesota is entitled to to other states such as the Dakotas in Iowa.

Unfortunately our doorbell camera doesn't catch the sign, because of some bushes.

First, I was in my office which has a clear view of the yard and a car pulled up I didn't recognize and they grabbed the sign. I ran downstairs and confronted the person who threw it on the street and tore off. They had other signs in their piece of shit white dodge minivan. 

Second, today, a *preteen aged girl* whom we KNOW rolled up on her bike. I had my windows open and heard her say """"you have got to be fucking kidding me"""" and she got her phone out, started taking pictures, then got off the bike and started walking up to the sign. I yelled """"leave it alone"""" and she panicked and scrambled off.

I am blown away by this. 

People are weird. I would never in my life consider ripping out a yard sign.



Edit: for those wondering, yes I did get the plate and call it in. And no i did not reach out to the parents of the kid. They are one of those families that has 5+ kids, homeschooling while the dad makes the big bucks. I'd likely get shouted at vs anything productive. 


Edit 2: we slapped a walz sticker on a Harris sign since the joint ones weren't available 





Edit 3: im in the SW metro. I setup another cam, just in case. I've gotten some nice DMs from Trump supporters saying they apologize on behalf of the degenerates. I've also gotten some doxxing threats from burner accounts I'm just ignoring. One person said I was lying and they would dox me if I didn't update my post with proof.

Between Prince, Bob Dylan, and ***all*** of the venison, Minnesota has no shortage of contributions to the rest of the Nation. But much like that one Halloween blizzard, this one will also be remembered for decades to come.

Tim Walz was possibly Minnesota’s best kept secret besides your friend’s cabin up north. He served in the military for over 2 decades, was a social studies teacher, and once he became your Governor accomplished an insane amount and did so much good for Minnesota with a single seat majority in the Legislature. He managed to guarantee paid leave, passed Minnesota’s biggest infrastructure bill ever, guaranteed women’s Right to Choose, put tampons in every gal’s bathroom, got automatic Voter Registration across the finish line, invested in education, and - what I personally consider the most meaningful as a kid who went hungry a lot - guaranteed Minnesota’s kids got fed at school.

He’s a dad, a hunter, and represents Minnesota Nice better than anyone who has ever escaped a Minnesota Goodbye at a potluck.

But while Minnesota loses by having Tim Walz elevated to the National stage, America gains.

After almost a decade of chaos, of corruption, of lies and treason, of everything lowly and terrible about being American - of all the ish that’s different - Tim is a breath of fresh air, and is exactly what America needs in this moment. 

Unlike the Vikings, because of Tim Walz, this is our year.

We have Minnesota to thank for bringing this seasonal depression to an end, for spring to come again, and for we Americans to reject MAGA, to reject hatred, xenophobia, racism, cruelty and greed once and for all. 

The state that still proudly keeps the treasonous rebel flag on display to prove every day that good triumphs over evil, is once again stepping up to the plate asking to scooch right past all of the weirdness and insisting yet again to do your part to make America a better place for all of us.

I believe news  in general is a polarizing factor. I'm not one to lie and be dishonest- is there issues in the Somali community, yes but it feels like global right wing online trolls and main stream media focuses on every bad detail and unless if someone personally knows someone who is Somali or interacted with many of us and is familiar with our culture would see us  as as an alien barbaric  race and not as just normal people who live lives, own businesses, work, have families and have hobbies like anyone else.

I see food as a proxy of how people interact with other cultures, I worked in several corporate jobs where we have lunch as a team or sometimes talk about food and Minnesotans like all other Americans like ethnic foods but never have I met anyone who ate Somali food.

Occasionally I worked with some people who knew some stuff about our culture and not some stereotypical shit. People are people and vary in their mannerisms and I personally think asking questions and getting to know people can most of the time alleviate any misconceptions.

This is an generalization but will use it as an example: I used to and perhaps other people who don't know Minnesotan white culture  would see Minnesotan whites as closed off, reserved, etc. I got to work with someone who was from a small town and though time I understood most of what I perceived as distance and standoffishness is just the manifestation of Scandinavian culture which values privacy, are very reserved, not that expressive to those who aren't in their circle . Also they are very polite, aren't that loud/expressive, and very punctual. Also inside jokes and especially sarcasm is more common and Wittiness. 

Also I don't know what this is but found it very hilarious but when Anthony Edwards from the Timberwolves told Charles Barkley to """"bring Ya Ass"""" and then it became like a living meme spectacle and was very creative. I seen many manifestations of that in other times,. Don't know the word for it but its definitely a Minnesotan thing.

older Somali men like to go to Starbucks or any coffee shop and sit in large groups and talk. Someone who isn't familiar would see it as odd but to us its quite normal, its their way of socialization. knowing little things like that in my opinion changes how someone views people.

one thing we Somalis do that is different then typical Minnesotan Scandinavian culture is that  we are flexible  within boundaries and like to negotiate, we like to have a """"dance"""" with words, try to persuade each other.  we joke it off and end things  amicably but someone who isn't familiar with this would see it as disrespect and not as a friendly way/ tease to resolve a dispute. Also a lot of non-verbal communication and expressions is common in Somali culture similar to many middle eastern and African cultures while in standard American Anglo culture and also Minnesota white culture, from my experience, they prefer getting to the point.   Also one big difference(from my experience), Minnesotans like to split bills when going out and when I invited one of my co-workers to a Somali restaurant for lunch, I paid his bill since he was my guest and he found that pleasantly surprising since he wasn't used to it.

This sorta small day to day  cultural mannerism differences is what I believe is is the heart of many misconceptions for all cultures.

and lastly, of course no one is the same and people vary and we people are all  individuals with our own personalities and distinct mannerisms. 

If you guys have any questions I can answer, and  also if I got anything inaccurate from my assessment from Minnesotan culture let me know


EDIT:


Many people were asking for list of restaurant so here it is, it’s not comprehensive just ones I went to or heard were good ..

Hufan restaurant- it has great food, they have great goat meat and great tea.

Quruxlow restaurant- the most popular somali restaurant in Minneapolis, unfortunately goat meat gets sold out early but they have great food here as well.

Black Sea deli- great food and it’s located in Burnsville.

Sambosa restaurant- Burnsville. —-also has great food but it’s an elderly woman and her son so you will need to wait a bit once you order but it’s incredible food and I highly recommend their tea as well.

West Bank diner- cedar riverside, Great food and it’s near West Bank U of M.

Olive kitchen- absolutely amazing food. It’s on 18th and Nicollet in south Minneapolis.

For dessert Halwa Kismayo- they serve Halwa which is a somali delicacy.

Mama Safia’s kitchen- I didn’t go but it’s highly rated. It’s near midtown global.

720 E Lake St, Minneapolis, MN 55407

Lastly spaghetti house- it’s a somali italian fusion restaurant. 

Also you can order somali pasta(Baasto) at any of the restaurant, it’s a savory, Aromatic pasta with somali herbs blend and the sauce is meaty with spices. 

Some of the restaurants might also have Tiramasu sometimes as a dessert but I don’t remember which ones.

The pasta and tiramisu came from Italian colonization of southern Somalia for those who were wondering.

","I'm a late 20s Somali male live in the twin city. I believe news in general be a polarize factor. I'm not one to lie and be dishonest - be there issue in the Somali community, yes but it feel like global right wing online troll and main stream medium focus on every bad detail and unless if someone personally know someone who be Somali or interact with many of us and be familiar with our culture would see us as as a alien barbaric race and not as just normal people who live life, own business, work, have family and have hobby like anyone else. I see food as a proxy of how people interact with other culture, I work in several corporate job where we have lunch as a team or sometimes talk about food and Minnesotans like all other american like ethnic food but never have I meet anyone who eat Somali food. Occasionally I work with some people who know some stuff about our culture and not some stereotypical shit. People be people and vary in their mannerism and I personally think ask question and get to know people can much of the time alleviate any misconception. This be a generalization but will use it as a example: I use to and perhaps other people who don't know Minnesotan white culture would see Minnesotan white as close off, reserve, etc. I get to work with someone who be from a small town and though time I understand much of what I perceive as distance and standoffishness be just the manifestation of Scandinavian culture which value privacy, be very reserve, not that expressive to that who aren't in their circle. Also they be very polite, aren't that loud / expressive, and very punctual. Also inside joke and especially sarcasm be much common and Wittiness. Also I don't know what this be but find it very hilarious but when Anthony Edwards from the Timberwolves tell Charles Barkley to "" "" bring you Ass "" "" and then it become like a live meme spectacle and be very creative. I see many manifestation of that in other time,. Don't know the word for it but its definitely a Minnesotan thing. old Somali man like to go to Starbucks or any coffee shop and sit in large group and talk. Someone who isn't familiar would see it as odd but to us its quite normal, its their way of socialization. know little thing like that in my opinion change how someone view people. one thing we somali do that be different then typical Minnesotan Scandinavian culture be that we be flexible within boundary and like to negotiate, we like to have a "" "" dance "" "" with word, try to persuade each other. we joke it off and end thing amicably but someone who isn't familiar with this would see it as disrespect and not as a friendly way / tease to resolve a dispute.

The committee will be making the final revisions this Tuesday, and the last public commentary period is currently open.

The last meeting was left very open ended as to which direction they would go with my flag, and some committee members were interested in changing the Minnesota shape to be more realistic, as well as removing the white stripe so the background resembles a landscape. I worry that they’re taking my design in a very literal and on-the-nose direction that takes away it’s timeliness and it’s symmetry.

All of that is to say, please let the committee know what you want 1953 to look like. If Minnesota being a symmetrical chevron is important to you, mention that. If you really want three equal stripes, mention that!

They compile and review every comment before the meeting, so your thoughts do make a difference.

Personally, I will be vouching for the beautiful revisions done by professional graphic designers Tyler and Jenae Michaletz (with assistance of Ted Kaye and Brian Cham). Their revisions accommodate the committee’s requests while also staying true to my original. I included their revisions in the first photo above, so feel free to send in a comment about any of those if you like them too.

Also, the 8-pointed star is almost a certainty at this point, and I actually don’t mind that, as the historical significance behind the star makes it a truly unique and meaningful Minnesotan symbol in a way that my original North Star can’t compete with (even if it’s prettier 😉).

And thank you all so much for your support! All of your posts, comments, and messages have been so meaningful to me.

Fairly empty train on the way there, packed full (till the Dells) on the way back.  Which is probably cheaper for me than driving (jeep gets maybe 17 mpg on a good day with a good tailwind) with gas and tolls l/paying for parking, factored in.  We stayed right near the Shedd and Field museum so walked aside from a bus to the hotel.  

Start with, difference between business and peasant class isn’t much.  Get on the train first, seats are a smidge bigger.  Seats in peasant class are plenty big, bigger than normal airline seats.  

WiFi is pretty shitty, and there are dead spots for cell coverage in some of the ruraler (new word I made up) areas.  Bring a book.  

Trip there was easy, 7 hours or so.  Little longer than driving, depending on pee stops.  Trip back we were delayed an hour and a half due to mechanical issues, so that sucked.  Info at the Chicago union depot was garbage.  Likely to arrive back in St Paul a hour and a half late.  

My only real gripe aside from the delay on the way back is I think they could cut out a few stops, stops in some small WI towns, one or two could be cut out, and twice in Milwaukee, could cut that to just one.  (I’m sure there is a reason they do this so this is just me bitching).


Anyways probably will go again, stress free once in the train, might try just a Dells trip as well since it’s a stop and takes about as much time as driving.   Views are fantastic from St. Paul through lacrosse.

I grew up in Wisconsin and served on active duty in the Marine Corps. I now live in Minneapolis and want to share the appreciation I have for the state of MN and why I am choosing to raise kids here.

1. Firstly, the Minnesota culture is inclusive and friendly. There exists a genuine good neighbor culture. Nowhere is without problems, but it incredible how much less sexism there is here relative to the rest of America.

2. The public programs are outstanding. Women's rights are respected. There are vehicles for everyone to find success. Nowhere is without things that can be improved, but the public education and public programs are superior relative to the rest of the country.

3. Citizens actually give a shit here, even if sometimes they disagree. People vote here.

4. We have clean, drinkable water and beautiful public parks. I served at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina for awhile. The water is polluted with jet fuel. It is unsafe to drink the water or trust public institutions.

5. MN is welcoming to immigrants and the LBTQ community. At least relatively much more welcoming than much of the rest of the US.

6. MN doesn't have a binge drinking problem like Wisconsin.

7. You get all 4 szns.

I grew up raised by a single mother below the federal poverty line. Minnesota public education enabled me to get a Master's degree. I didn't realize how good it is here until I left and served around the rest of the country.

I don't know why MN has turned out so well relative to others states (i.e. Wisconsin). Obviously we are not without problems here. But I can confirm this is a special place. There isn't a better place for me to give young girls a better opportunity to grow into strong women.

After serving in the Marine Corps and realizing I may soon die in China or Russia, I feel relatively proud about the citizens in MN and what ya'll do. It feels like what I am doing is worth it. So thank you all for everything.","Bottom Line Up Front: MN be a special place. The rest of the US be much bad. I grow up in Wisconsin and serve on active duty in the Marine corp.

About 330 students and community members marched peacefully across the University of Missouri campus Monday, calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.

Protesters gathered at Lowry Mall at 11 a.m., walked past Memorial Union and circled around Francis Quadrangle, repeating chants like, “No more weapons, no more war. Peace is what we’re fighting for” and “End the genocide.” 

Since November, MU student groups have held weekly demonstrations to protest the thousands of civilians killed and injured in Gaza from Israeli attacks, which were launched after Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 Israeli citizens and captured hundreds. Monday’s protest was the biggest by far.

The demonstration was organized by a coalition of five student organizations. The 90-minute protest ended with speeches by a few of the organizers.

”As students, we learn about history in the hopes that we can make sure that it doesn’t repeat itself, but we also need to acknowledge that student activism is an integral part of American history,” said Lima Sherzad, president of Mizzou Muslim Students’ Organization. “And change did not come easy; speaking out against injustices was not easy. Yet the students showed up time and time again. And there is where we need to draw our energy and momentum from. Each of us have a responsibility towards the people of Gaza and Palestinian to raise our voices and protest this brutal onslaught.”

Ian De Smet, co-chair of the Mizzou Young Democratic Socialists of America, stressed the power of gathering for a common effort. He urged students to stay active in local efforts as summer begins and students return home.

“Those bombs dropping on Gaza, they have the seal of the United States government, and we, as citizens, have the responsibility and the power to stand up,” De Smet said.

Organizers scheduled Monday’s demonstration on a weekday and encouraged students to walk out of class to participate, compared to the weekly protests on Saturdays.

Protests have proliferated across U.S. universities, including high-profile events at Columbia University, Yale University, the University of Texas at Austin, Emory University and the University of Southern California. Tensions have risen, and some of these demonstrations have been met with police action, arrests and student suspensions. On Monday afternoon, police arrested more than 100 protestors at Washington University in St. Louis. Local protest organizers said they wanted to ensure that Monday’s demonstration was peaceful.

Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine has helped organize Columbia’s weekly protests and plan Monday’s walkout.

MSJP worked with university officials to ensure the protest remained peaceful. MU spokesperson Christian Basi said administrators and organizers talked through logistics, such as specifying the route the march took and ensuring that marchers stayed on sidewalks to maintain a safe event.

Such protests highlight a difficult challenge for colleges: they need to be places where students can freely share ideas while also keeping everyone safe.

After the MU campus was roiled in 2015 by student protests of racial acts and insensitivity, the university modified some policies concerning protests and created new policies, such as a policy requiring permits for sound amplification.

But more than just creating policies, Basi said, “we were adamant about changing our interactions with student groups. That was very much on display today,” he said. The university has “had very positive conversations with student groups.

“While the university does not endorse a particular viewpoint of anyone on the campus or any student group, by being in contact with us, we were able to make sure that they were aware of all of our policies as well as our procedures and provide them with some information to ensure their event could go off smoothly and without a hitch,” Basi said. “And that’s exactly what happened today.”

MSJP’s Isleen Atallah said the conflict in Gaza is a local issue. “The situation in Palestine is not just a distant conflict; it’s a humanitarian crisis that demands global attention,” she said. “We are here to remind our community and the world that peace is possible, but it requires action from all of us.”

MU junior Sanya Suri said she came to Monday’s walkout to speak out on behalf of the innocent people in Palestine. “Everyone deserves peace. Everyone deserves their own land. Everyone deserves access to food, water, and education,” Suri said. “Everyone honestly just deserves to be treated like a human being, and that’s not what’s happening right now,” Suri said she tries to attend the Saturday protests when she can as well.

Michael Volz, faculty advisor for MSJP, said he was glad students had the freedom to express their concerns about what is happening in Gaza.

“Speaking for myself and not the university, my hope is that people who come here will continue to write to their political leaders and to speak out in the hopes that we hold the U.S. government accountable,” said Volz, an associate professor of Chinese and director of MU’s International Studies Program.

The conflict escalated following an attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, which killed at least 1,200 people in Israel, according to CNN. That prompted intense military attacks by Israel across Gaza, affecting hospitals, residential areas, and critical infrastructure. As of the latest reports by Al Jazeera, the death toll in Gaza stands at 34,979 Palestinians, including more than 14,500 children and 8,400 women. Additionally, over 77,643 people have been injured, and more than 8,000 are missing.

The significant destruction to Gaza’s infrastructure has had a profound humanitarian impact. More than half of Gaza’s homes, 360,000 residential units, have been either destroyed or damaged. Educational facilities, hospitals, places of worship, and vital water sources have also suffered extensive damage. The ongoing conflict has increased the challenges faced by the people of Gaza, who have been living under a blockade since 2007, restricting the movement of goods and people and severely limiting access to basic services.

Rasha Abousalem, a humanitarian aid worker and MU adjunct professor discussed the challenges of delivering aid in Gaza. “Once it reaches those checkpoints and it’s transferred from Egyptian trucks into Palestinian trucks, a lot of the aid...is damaged. Some of the aid is taken, and then, after several days, to enter into the warehouses, then you have the issue of people, some groups, taking it inside Gaza and selling it on the black market,” Abousalem said.

Noah Citron, a community member who is part of Columbia Jews for Ceasefire, said several members of the organization were in attendance.

“I have been seeing a lot in the media that Jews, portrayed as a single voice, are not feeling safe at events like this. Personally, as a Jew, I felt perfectly safe,” Citron said. “There was not one moment where I felt unsafe around anyone attending this protest.”

Citron said the protest taking place during one of the last days of Passover was particularly timely.

“Every year, we talk about how the Jewish people’s story of Passover kind of represents all people who are oppressed. And so I feel like this is so timely to be talking about.”","[ https: / / www. columbiamissourian. com / news / high _ education / mu - student - stage - protest - call - for - a - ceasefire - in - israel - hamas - war / ] ( https: / / www. columbiamissourian. com / news / high _ education / mu - student - stage - protest - call - for - a - ceasefire - in - israel - hamas - war / article _ bd568da0 - 0658 - 11ef - a1fd - 23619f6f5a94. html ) About 330 student and community member march peacefully across the University of Missouri campus Monday, call for a cease - fire in the Israel - Hamas war. protester gather at Lowry Mall at 11 a. be., walk past Memorial Union and circle around Francis Quadrangle, repeat chant like, “ No much weapon, no much war.

2. Because doctors who can do this face an end to their career, prison or (at minimum) unimaginable liabilities, they just leave the state

This law is cruel and unusual. Only a handful of countries in the Middle East (such as Iran and Palestine) address women's health this way.

It's worth it to fight against a law that is irresponsible. There is no reason to wait until this affects your daughter, your sister, your wife or another loved one. The law is irresponsible because we know that mothers will get pregnant and that they will require emergency abortions of pregnancies at some rate (hopefully a very, very low rate). We also know that no doctor could be expected to live and operate in Missouri while enduring this legal and financial liability every day.

The most appalling part of this is that the lawmakers who are most in favor of this """"scheme"""" for women's health hail from districts and communities who will be disproportionately affected by it. It will be poor families from rural regions of Missouri who cannot afford to travel quickly (if at all) when an emergency arises that will be condemned to death by this law. And it is """"when"""" not """"if.""""

The time to help with this issue or get out of the way has arrived. There are lawmakers in Missouri's legislature today who are against ANY modifications to our current laws. We are left with few avenues for how they arrive at that position. It could be that they are evil, but just as likely they have a very low intellectual horsepower and rather than standing aside to let better minds work, they weaponize that lack of intellect (or compassion) in facor of a white-knuckle grip on power.

In any case, I appeal to any person who reads this to take the following steps:

1. Share this, and let people read and understand why this is a problem and why we have to fix it

2. Begin contributing, weekly or monthly, to a political campaign in your district with an amount you can (easily) afford.

Even a dollar a week, with many thousands of participants, arms people with compassion and intellect around this issue to PUT UP THE FIGHT. If your district is already represented by the right minds, consider donating to the campaigns of districts where the wrong minds are winning. Because no amount is too small to help, and we should put up one CRAZY fight for this.","I want to start by explain that I be a father, a husband, a son.

She plays one of the drug dealers for the notorious Taum Sauk Gang. Her character China Rose comes to terms with the violent lifestyle she has chosen. 

As the Assistant Director I have been working atmospheric effects, first aid, tree trimming, landscaping, craft services, managing production assistants, directing actors, coordinating logistics, and other jobs like scorpion removal, horse crap shoveler, transpo, locations, security, local outreach, and assisting the art, make up, and lighting departments in a minor capacity.

Several of these BTS stills are from our talented photographer Tiffany Banks, instagram handle @Tiff.The.Shooter, there are 4 very high quality pictures here that represent a labor of love. 

This has been an outstanding production process with each member of the crew reaching into their bag of tricks. 

Down the Long River tells the story of a civil war doctor driven mad with PTSD who seeks revenge on his former band of brothers, The Taum Sauk Gang. He has tracked them to a location where they are planning a big score as a paddle wheel boat is bringing a shipment of gold down the long river. 

The film stars Matt Cardona formerly of the WWE and the death match king in his first film role.

This is just one of many weird experiences I had during that time:

I arrived back at the office after my lunch break one day and saw a new email from a concerned Hardin citizen. She said she witnessed a Hardin police officer run over a dog in his squad car on Hwy 313 outside of town. The officer then apparently got out of his car, shot the dog numerous times... and left it on the side of the road. 

I got in my car and took Hwy 313 out of town to check it out. Sure enough, I came across the body of a dead dog on the side of the road. I pulled over and parked my car. Walking up to the dog, I could see blood and bullet wounds. It was a grisly sight, so I didn't stay too long. 

As I walked back to my vehicle, an old, beat-up car with tinted windows pulled over on the side of the road right behind me. I stood there for a second before walking up to the car's window to see if they needed help. 

I waved and stood by the driver's side, expecting someone to get out and talk to me, but no one did. They just sat there behind the tinted windows and didn't move. 

I started to feel creeped out, so I quickly walked back to my car and got in. As I was throwing it in drive, I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw that a man had gotten out of the car and was approaching me. 

I was on high alert so I rolled down my window a bit to see what the guy wanted. He said he was running low on gas and asked if I could give him some money to fill up. I offered to drive back into Hardin with him to go to the gas station. 

He followed me back into town, and we pulled up to Town Pump. I paid for his gas and started talking to him while we filled up his car. I looked inside the car and saw another man completely slumped backward in the passenger seat. I don't know if he was on drugs, dead, or sleeping, but he wasn't moving at all. 

I asked the guy if his friend was okay. He mumbled something I could barely hear and shrugged it off. 

For the rest of the conversation, we talked about fishing. I don't remember much else. We filled up 18 gallons in his car, which was almost the entire tank. Meaning this guy had been driving out on Hwy 313 basically into the wilderness with almost no gas left in the middle of winter. It was odd to say the least.

The dog's body stayed on the side of the road. I was living outside of Hardin at the time, so I'd drive by the body every day on my way to and from work. It snowed one weekend, and the dog's body was covered by snow and ice. No one was held accountable, nothing happened. I didn't really know what to do, if anything, about it at the time. 

Just an overall weird story that kind of sums up what it was like during my time there. Another notable event was a homeless man killed while sleeping outside the library.

I look inside the car and see another man completely slump backward in the passenger seat. I don't know if he be on drug, dead, or sleep, but he wasn't move at all. I ask the guy if his friend be okay. He mumble something I can barely hear and shrug it off. For the rest of the conversation, we talk about fish. I don't remember much else. We fill up 18 gallon in his car, which be almost the entire tank. mean this guy have be drive out on Hwy 313 basically into the wilderness with almost no gas leave in the middle of winter. It be odd to say the less. The dog's body stay on the side of the road. I be live outside of Hardin at the time, so I'd drive by the body every day on my way to and from work. It snow one weekend, and the dog's body be cover by snow and ice. No one be hold accountable, nothing happen. I didn't really know what to do, if anything, about it at the time. Just a overall weird story that kind of sum up what it be like during my time there. Another notable event be a homeless man kill while sleep outside the library. have a rock drop on his head...","Montana","Extremely weird experience I had while working in Hardin","Extremely weird experience I have while work in Hardin","{""choices"":[""Crime and Law Enforcement"",""Transportation and Infrastructure"",""Culture and Recreation""]}","2024-11-19T01:12:49.292765Z","https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/1bw3oph/extremely_weird_experience_i_had_while_working_in/"

It does not often happen that there is a pullout right where you need it to be for a good composition on a beautiful scene, but that is exactly what happened one fall morning, a few years ago as I meandered along Hyalite Creek. The morning sun had just crested the ridge up river and its golden light flowed downstream with the creek. It back lit these Cottonwoods and a nearby Douglas Fir tree in a way that absolutely insisted that I stop and capture the glow. Now, scientifically speaking, water flows much more slowly than light, but in an artistic sense, warm light travels more like sticky syrup and deliciously coats everything it is poured over. This gave me time to run upstream and down, looking for the angle to most faithfully capture the awe-inspiring scene before me.","It do not often happen that there be a pullout right where you need it to be for a good composition on a beautiful scene, but that be exactly what happen one fall morning, a few year ago as I meander along Hyalite Creek.

You never know what a day may bring or who you may meet. On this morning back in 2016, I had intended to photograph the sunrise in Big Sky, Montana. It was a typical mountain sunrise with wispy cirrus clouds dancing across the sky. The clouds turned from red to pink and then orange as the Sun began to greet the morning with its glorious light. Fantastic patterns had formed in the ice of the puddle in front of me. Soon the first rays of light began to gently kiss the tops of the peaks much like your Grandma kissing your forehead in a loving greeting. I was kneeling there, on the frozen ground, waiting for the light to get just right, when this precious creature came along. She sat down opposite me and we watched the sun come up together. We engaged in polite conversation about the weather. We watched the Sun chase the shadows down the flanks of Lone Mountain. Occasionally a bird called out its melodious “good morning”. Nothing more really needed to be said. The moment spoke for itself. We enjoyed each other’s company for ten minutes or so and then she got up and ambled off into the forest. I packed up my camera gear and went on about my day, grateful for what I’d just experienced and for my conversation with a Fox.","You never know what a day may bring or who you may meet.

There are a few roads, but they wind invitingly through the mountains. They beg for you to go just a little bit farther, just a little bit higher, because they know what is around the corner and they know you need to experience it. Flowers abound in an array of color that you would not dare imagine. They bob their head in the breeze like lazy dancers on a hot summer day. If the flora are rich and thick, the fauna are wild and free. From the tiny Voles that help aerate the soil to the Great Grey Owls that hunt them from the air or from the Mule Deer graze in the meadows to the Grizzly Bears that dominate the food chain, this is a truly wild place. There are vast meadows lined with stately Fir Trees. There are rocky precipices and ponds which reflect the grand landscape better than any mirror. There are dense forests protecting unseen wildlife and there are windswept alpine ridges where stunted flowers take shelter behind the rocks.

During the day, the whole mountain range is alive with wildlife and plants doing what they must to continue the existence of their species. Forget-Me-Nots sway in the breeze, Bee’s zoom about, Moose browse the willows, Beavers inspect their handiwork, and Birds sing a melody fitting for such a glorious place. It is good to sit for a spell and just absorb the tranquility.

Now, I am usually an “early to bed, early to rise” sort of a guy, but when you’re up here, you feel compelled to stay up to watch the stars come out. As the last shades of sunset fade to black, the stars begin appearing on the stage of night. It is a show that you do not want to miss. On top of the mountains, there is no such thing as a bad seat. Tonight would be a grand show indeed as galaxies, planets, and a phenomena known as airglow would be headlining the show. It is exciting to stand in the dark and wonder what creatures may be watching you. Up here it could be just about any animal that calls Montana home. As lightning flashed far to my north and the sliver of the crescent Moon ducked behind the storm clouds, I began to capture the images needed for this panorama. While the camera certainly enhances what is there, I could see this scene with my unaided eyes. I didn’t even need a flashlight to see around me, although I did admittedly shine a light around occasionally to make sure that I would not become someone’s midnight snack!

Wild places, be they at sea level on a rocky California coastline or high above tree line in the Montana Rockies, make me happy. A place where every living thing has a purpose and is permitted to carry out that function. A place where the stars are as visible as the flowers and I can take the time to admire them both. A place where I can witness the Sun greeting the morning with its glorious rays and watch it sink below the horizon on the other side of the sky. Ahhhh, wilderness, a place where I belong.

There be a few road, but they wind invitingly through the mountain. They beg for you to go just a little bite far, just a little bite high, because they know what be around the corner and they know you need to experience it. flower abound in a array of color that you would not dare imagine. They bob their head in the breeze like lazy dancer on a hot summer day. If the flora be rich and thick, the fauna be wild and free. From the tiny vole that help aerate the soil to the Great Grey owl that hunt them from the air or from the Mule Deer graze in the meadow to the Grizzly bear that dominate the food chain, this be a truly wild place. There be vast meadow line with stately Fir tree. There be rocky precipice and pond which reflect the grand landscape good than any mirror. There be dense forest protect unseen wildlife and there be windswept alpine ridge where stunt flower take shelter behind the rock. During the day, the whole mountain range be alive with wildlife and plant do what they must to continue the existence of their species. Forget - Me - Nots sway in the breeze, Bee ’ s zoom about, Moose browse the willow, beaver inspect their handiwork, and bird sing a melody fit for such a glorious place.

The river had been up to some mischief! With the air temp near zero, slushy ice formed wherever the water was disturbed. Riffles caused by submerged stones helped introduce frigid air to the super-cooled water. In one particular area, faster water enters a region of more still water.  Shelves of solid ice along the shores created an area with a back-current. Flowing ice was lured in and molded into a perfectly spinning circle. It was like a gear in a dream machine. The dream it created is obscurely reflected in the downstream pool. 

Meanwhile, clouds danced overhead competing with the motion of the river for my attention. These ephemeral ice phenomena are fantastic things to observe. The soft scrape of slush against ice made for a soundtrack that was as magical to my ears as the ice circle was to my eyes.  Then, in just moments, the clouds passed, the circle ceased movement as it jammed against the shelf ice, and the moment vanished the way a dream in the night gives way to the reality of day.

We all view things from a different angle. Circumstances, beliefs, abilities, and experiences all alter the way we perceive what we see. One Autumn day several years ago, I was looking for a sunrise shot in Big Sky, Montana. I got out of bed extra early to make the hour and a half drive to this location. I drove all over the place, carefully eyeing every tree, meadow, and rock pile. I was losing that glorious light of the golden hour after sunrise. I was feeling a bit defeated and headed back down, disappointed that I had been unable to find an image to capture. 

I looked back over my shoulder for one last glance at Lone Mountain as I passed a roadside pullout. Days of gloomy, rainy weather had left a glimmer of hope in a mud puddle. I turned the truck around quicker than you could say """"photo-op""""! It didn't take me long to determine that I may have found my shot. Mountains have always inspired me. I like to learn their names. I like to stand on their summits and dream in their valleys. Lone Mountain is an Iconic peak. It can be photographed from so many different angles and they are all amazing! Thing is, there were a lot of distracting objects in the background. I had to get right down in the mud to get the angle I needed. I actually set the base of my camera in the water and laid right down on the wet ground to compose the shot.

 By changing my perspective, I was able to eliminate the distractions and focus on the beauty of the scene. Life is like that. There are storms that come and go. Some stick around longer than others. There are times when it may seem like the rain will never stop. It is times like this that you've got to get a little dirt on your hands to get new perspective on your situation. Problems don't usually fix themselves. They often require grace, humility, and good old-fashioned, down-and-dirty hard work! I bet if you're willing to do that, you might just find something beautiful in a mud puddle!","We all view thing from a different angle. circumstance, belief, ability, and experience all alter the way we perceive what we see.

We're looking at decimating school budgets when these massive corporate farms could just pay at a slightly higher rate, while keeping the lower rate for farms that are the primary residence of their owners.

---‐--------------------------------------------  


Edit: I must not have explained this well. Most important thing is that I'm spitballing here, not writing actual tax policy. I didn't think this through as much as some of you seem to think I should have. If you have other ideas, let's hear them. Just try not to assume I'm personally ruining the lives of every old McDonald farm with a reddit post, dang.  

Starting with the most egregious: I'm not asking farmers to pay for city folks' funerals.  

Absentee landlords own 44% of Nebraska farmland. Like any other entity that buys multiple properties they only use for rent money, I think they should be taxed more. Not only would this bring in more revenue for state and local governments, it could discourage out-of-state buyers from continuing to snatch up local land. The price of Nebraska farmland increased 41% from 2018 to 2023. This is pricing out local buyers who would actually farm their own land and be part of the community. (Bonus that people generally try not to poison the groundwater where they live- corporations, and [Pillen's pig farms](https://flatwaterfreepress.org/pillens-water-high-nitrate-detected-on-hog-farms-owned-by-nebraskas-governor/) are less cautious)

The current proposal would raise farming costs in total, as the new taxes include agricultural equipment, maintenence, chemicals, and other costs. As I said above, these taxes are exempted for livestock. It's an incredibly pointed ommission from somebody who has bragged about making 2/5 of the bacon sold in the US and Canada. 

Pillen's tax plan shifts school budget control from local to state government. The governor would control which schools across the state get funding. He- or anyone in his position- would be able to unilaterally control what schools teach by offering or withholding funds. 

That funding, by the way, would be slashed >90% from 1.05% of property taxes to 0.15% of property taxes. Remember, residential property taxes would be cut by more than 50%, so we're looking at around 5% of the budget schools are currently struggling to get by on. 

I don't have kids, but honestly what kind of person thinks schools should face a 95% budget reduction?? Even if you absolutely hate children, those kids grow up into adults in the community. I don't know about you, but I want the paramedic who treats me after an accident to have had a halfway decent education. 

I'm getting off topic. Sorry. 

The point is that the current tax plan fucking sucks. It raises prices on necessary goods and services for everyone, which means people with less money will be paying a greater percentage of what they have. Farmers would be among those people. Ag land owners who don't even live in the state would not be. 

Again, I'm not proposing we raise taxes on people who work their own farms. Pillen is. He's trying to tax them 5.5% more on what they need to get by. 

Finally, I have no influence over tax policy. I'm just some girl on reddit. If I did have control over our state government, I'd ban VIN pairing, legalize weed, let people make their own informed healthcare decisions, and start to transition our power from coal and methane to solar, wind and nuclear. (I'd also require wind turbines to have at least [one black blade](https://group.vattenfall.com/press-and-media/newsroom/2022/black-turbine-blades-reduce-bird-collisions).)

[https://governor.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/doc/press/Exemptions-Only-List2.pdf](https://governor.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/doc/press/Exemptions-Only-List2.pdf)

Some lowlights in the exemption list:

\- Pet services (taking your pets to the vet, having them groomed, trimming their nails, etc)

\- Lottery tickets

\- Agricultural machinery and equipment (farming is about to get more expensive)

\- Net metering of electricity

\- Tickets to any zoo or aquarium

\- Telecommunication access charges (your phone bill is going up)

\- Personal instruction (swimming lessons, dance lessons, etc.  Sorry parents who already pay out the nose for your kids activities, they're about to get 5.5% more expensive)

And a bunch of others.  Entire categories of things are about to get more expensive, like tax preparation, home maintenance (plumbers are now 5.5% more expensive to hire).

In the end, us middle class home owners will be lucky if the """"property tax relief"""" saves us anything once you factor in the increased taxes and having to give up the income tax credit.  But you know who is going to get a buttload of free money?  People with large expensive properties.  Landlords.  You know who gets extremely screwed?  Anyone who doesn't own property.  Renters get all the tax increases and none of the tax relief.","Some major detail: \ - propose reduce property tax by \ ~50 % by 2026 \ - remove the current property tax relief system that be in place.

These work schedules were made between management and their employees based on employee performance and whether the specific job was conducive to a hybrid schedule. However, the current Governor doesn’t believe this should occur. His disparaging remarks to the media about remote work show a lack of understanding of the benefits of remote work, the future of work, the needs of the workforce, workforce development, and the importance of autonomy of managers in the executive branch to make their own decisions. Let’s hope this is a temporary change.","Governor Lombardo recently dissolve all divisional and agency level remote work policy and all exist remote work agreement for state employee.

As we pulled out of Starbucks, we took a moment to look at the roller coaster from a distance. I saw there was parking lot that would open up to the back of the roller coaster, So we decided to head over and check it out (this was before I googled and found it had been out of service for awhile) We found a car parked in the back that seemed beat up. Upon closer inspection, the car had a note on it with bright orange paper. There was a construction hat in the windshield and that was all we could see from driving by.  My mom wanted to check it out because we couldn’t see the writing and I was noooot into that.  We both have Fire and EMS background so there was a little concern someone may need help.

She checked the note and I, the backseats. There was nobody in the back and the note said the car had broken down and someone would be back for it. Normal enough. What’s not normal is that after we got back in the car and started driving out, an all white pickup truck came racing up behind us in this parking lot and getting close enough to hit us. We were really confused and made a move to get the hell out of there because it felt like…intimidation? I thought it also might’ve been a teenager or something dicking around but I wasn’t taking chances. The truck turned a corner, and was in the normal flow of traffic away from us. 

When leaving that lot, we passed by a casino directly leaving the roller coaster lot. There were two huge semi trucks backed into the loading bay of this casino, both Pepsi big haulers unloading. This will be important later. When we went to leave to get back on the road to Vegas, there were two White trucks tinted windows and no license plates (same as the one before) in the parking lot nearest to us facing the road to turn. When we went straight to get onto the roundabout, they followed. We went around TWICE and they followed. By this point, we were a little freaked but not into being intimidated and a little dumb probably. We decided to park in the big mall to see if they were cops and maybe were wanting to talk to us. Soon as we parked, they passed and left the mall lot. We couldn’t see either of them the windows were so dark. 

We went into the mall. We were both a little freaked and wanted to ask some questions to the workers as they were probably local. This mall was definitely dead. We went into Tommy Bahama, and talked to the clerk about the deal with the roller coaster. She said it’s hasn’t been up and running for a while. I asked her why there were two casinos right across from each other, she said the roof partially collapsed on one of them and left it unusable for a while and that she didn’t know why there were two but that it was a good idea given only one works. I asked her which one collapsed, she told me the one closest to the roller coaster.  

The same casino that was partially collapsed is the one that I saw had two semis backed into the loading dock with people actively unloading things. Why would there be two semis with workers unloading from a “Pepsi” truck into a non working casino? We left the mall, got into the car to leave for Vegas as we had been in Primm for about an hour. Driving away, there were Two white pickups, and a small white car quite literally pulling into the lot as we are leaving, turning around driving in a line and followed us to the roundabout to get onto the on ramp. Once we got onto the highway, they did not follow and stayed on the roundabout. 

Listen, is there some shady shit going on over there or were people just fucking with us? I think about this a lot and my mom and I have talked about it quite a bit.

They say part of the advantage is no income or sales tax. But since 1923 NH has taxed interest and dividends, I&D, earned above a certain amount. Originally, in 1923 one had to have more than $1200 per year in I&D, $2400 for a couple. In that day the average family income (all income) was about $3500, so a $2400 limit on just I&D meant only the richest paid this tax. 

Of course, over time incomes went up but the limit did not, so more people were subjected to the tax, but still only a small minority of NH residents.  In about 1995, the limit was doubled to $2400 and $4800 for couples, where it stands today. Still most people are not subjected to this tax, I&D in retirement accounts such as IRAs, 401k, SEPs, etc, where most average folks generate most of their interest and dividends, are not taxed by I&D tax.

Over the past two years the I&D tax has been being phased out and is slated to be gone next year. State spending cuts were not enacted to offset the loss of state revenue. Don't be misled, states cannot run an deficit like the federal government, they must balance their budgets. (Keep that in mind when you hear governors boasting they had a balanced budget each year they were governor. Yeah okay, dude.) To balance the budget, a favorite method for NH, and many states, is to send less money back to towns. Of course, this just leads to town taxes going up. In NHs case, this means even higher property tax increases.   
  
The argument to eliminate the I&D tax was that NH should not have an income tax, which few people ever did think NH had, but hey, it was one argument. Another popular argument was that more senior citizens are being subjected to the I&D tax, so it should be eliminated for the 'seniors', but really only pretty wealthy seniors were subjected to the tax, your writer included. The arguments against were that it was the only progressive tax on NH residents, versus the regressive property tax, etc. I&D tax is the only NH tax individuals pay that is not regressive and actually progressive. Property taxes, liquor, lottery, fees, etc revenue sources are generally regressive due to rich people not paying proportionally equal or more.

So why am I writing this today? The nominees for NH governor, Craig and Ayotte are both throwing around deceptions and misleading statements regarding the other raising taxes and them not. Priceless. 

In a nutshell, Craig has said she is open to bringing back or not eliminating the I&D tax, but having a much higher limit than 4800, so only the rich will be subjected to the tax and even fewer of the already few seniors will be subjected to the tax. So, Ayotte says Craig wants an income tax, but Ayotte, like a true NH person, never used to call the I&D tax an income tax! Craig does not want an income tax, but is willing to keep the over 100 year old I&D tax. Craig says Ayotte is raising property taxes! She is not, but her policy of not keeping the I&D tax will prevent as much money going from the state to towns, which is likely to lead to high property taxes.

It is very important to note that **there are areas currently under warnings that should not be**, including the Upper CT River Valley & Seacoast.

**Conditions**:  Snow overspreads after sunset tonight, with the heaviest expected from dawn to early afternoon Sunday. **Travel conditions will be at their worst mid afternoon Sunday, when a sharp 7-11°F drop in surface temperatures behind the low flash freezes melted snow & water laden snowflakes on surfaces. This will be most noticeable in/southeast of Manchester, where air temperatures start near freezing.** Forecast pavement temperatures from my company's in-house weather model are mildly alarming, I'll leave it at that. 

**Expected Snowfall**: We're in the timeframe where a final call has to be made in narrowing and expanding/contracting ranges, despite any lingering uncertainty. That said, with the exception of several key changes the majority of the forecast remains consistent with the previous. Note that I've elected to give """"best guess"""" single snowfall amounts, which fall within the forecast range at each select location.

1. Guidance has come to better consensus on a QPF maximum in the Monadnock Region, which expands upon the concern discussed Friday for locally enhanced totals there from orographic processes. I've elected to **expand the 12-16"""" range through Dublin, Fitzwilliam, Greenville, Nelson, & Lyndeborough**.
2. Guidance has come to better consensus on a second QPF maximum across interior sections of SE NH away from the Seacoast, where a mesoscale band is likely to form & loiter. This band will be narrow on the order of 1-2 towns wide. I've **increased snowfall amounts under this band to 12-16"""", which includes Rochester, Northwood, Barrington, Nottingham, & Somersworth**. Amounts flanking this band have also been **increased to 8-12"""", which includes Strafford, Farmington, Epsom, Dover, & Newmarket**. This increase does reflect the """"worst case scenario"""" amounts offered on Thursday, which were derived from a blend near the 75th percentile of all guidance amounts. Note that this band can wobble north/south, which will move the highest snow totals with it.

As is typical with New England snow events, the first storm is always the biggest pain. There's a lot to get through, let's dive into the latest.

**Storm Uncertainty:** This is not your typical nor'easter, in fact it's nowhere close to normal. **This is a complex storm with several moving parts**; any deviation of which can result in noticeable swings in snowfall. There is still (at the time of writing this post) **considerable and even greater uncertainty on low track and speed** between our core ensemble forecast systems: the GEFS (American), ECMWF EPS (European), & GEPS (Canadian). **It is entirely possible that we do not have a better handle on low track, speed, and mesoscale banding features downstream of track until Saturday.**

**Headlines:** The Winter Storm Watch continues for Cheshire, Hillsborough, Rockingham & Strafford Counties. This likely will be replaced with a Winter Storm Warning & an introduction of Winter Weather Advisories by Friday night.

**General Timeline:** Snow will increase in intensity overnight Saturday (after midnight) through Sunday, with the heaviest snowfall likely confined in a **12 hour period stretching from 3 AM Sunday to 3 PM Sunday.** **Travel conditions will be (counter-intuitively) be at their worst Sunday afternoon** as temps crash, which will allow snow to stick to roadways easier.

**Expected Snowfall:** Here is the first call for """"most likely"""" snowfall amounts from Saturday night through Sunday. The heaviest snow will fall in/south along a line extending from Keene to Greenfield, Manchester, & Raymond, which quickly tapers from south to north given my current expectation of a flatter storm track and tremendous amounts of dry air to the north. Snow consistency will vary largely from north to south across the state. **Light, fluffy snow is expected north, with heavy, wet snow further south.** Folks who have already perused the NWS forecast should note that **my thinking significantly deviates from theirs at the Seacoast**. This is a careful consideration of onshore flow (above freezing in the low-levels) largely inhibiting snow from adding up there until the majority of the storm is finished:

**Worst Case Snowfall**: Given unusually large track uncertainty at this time, there is a scenario where this low & attendant upper-level spin receives a potent kick from another plume of upper-level spin ejecting from the Canadian Prairies. This would allow for a low track much further north, a much stronger warm front, and higher snowfall amounts across the state. **The following gridded forecast is not the expected snowfall forecast**, rather an assessment of this  """"worst case"""" scenario:

Tonight’s commute was like a live action version of a NatGeo special featuring New Hampshire wildlife. 

It started before I left the driveway. I saw a bald eagle circling the lake looking for fish. Awesome.

 Then I pass the horse farm; 4 horses are out in the corral just watching the world go by. Right turn, and it’s deer (about 10 or so) grazing in the huge open field at dusk. Left turn and here come the wild turkeys in the road; they were in zero hurry to get out of the way. Cool with me; I’m in no hurry to get to work right now. 

Next I drive past the small family farm with a cow, a couple of goats, chickens and ducks. 

And to finish it off, as I pull into the parking lot, my headlights shine on a big rabbit in the side grass. 

(Honorable mention to the roadkill - squirrel, skunk, opossum, and a bird. Sorry but it counts)

Seriously, where else can someone experience that much wildlife in a 27 minute commute? New Hampshire is such a beautiful state where nature is right out your back door. Hell, the first moose I ever saw was walking down Bridge St in Manchester on an early Sunday morning. 

The icing on the cake was driving home after work with the windows down listening to the peepers. Signs of spring.

Hilariously, model uncertainty got worse (higher) overnight and is even higher as of our mid-day guidance suite. Let's dive in to what I know & what I don't know:

**Forecast Uncertainty**: We are under 36 hours from snow starting and I can confidently state that the spread in our """"big three"""" superensemble (GEFS, ECM EPS, & GEPS) is even wider than it was Thursday. I can gauge this uncertainty by low center location spread, which is an **astounding 225-250 miles wide** for Sunday's forecast. This spread is tied into fine differences in latitudinal location of a sharp temperature gradient and when a vorticity max exiting Canada kicks/phases with this system. As I discussed Thursday, **it is entirely possible that we do not have a better handle on low track, speed, and mesoscale banding features downstream of track until Saturday.**

**Forecast Uncertainty**: The Winter Storm Watch has been expanded to include Sullivan, Merrimack, Belknap, & southern Carroll Counties. This will likely be replaced with both Winter Storm Warnings & Winter Weather Advisories by early Saturday.

**Conditions**: Snow consistency will vary largely across the state, with heavy wet snow likely in/south of Concord. Snow overspreads Saturday night, with the heaviest expected from dawn to early afternoon Sunday. **Travel conditions will be at their worst mid afternoon Sunday, when a sharp 7-11°F drop in surface temperatures behind the low rapidly freezes melted snow & water laden snowflakes on surfaces. Aggressive road treatment protocols will be mandatory to avoid larger incidents on I-93, US-3, and NH-101 south of Concord.** 

**Expected Snowfall:** The current """"most likely"""" snowfall forecast remains largely unchanged across the state, though there are several additions. I'll also note that my competition's ranges are either laughably large (media) or aggressive in certain areas (NWS).

Based on previous experience at my prior weather job in NH, **I've increased amounts to 12-16""""** for easterly terrain exposures in the Monadnock Region to account for orographic processes & potential influence from a coastal front nearby. This includes NH-101 at the terrain gap in Temple, NH-31 at the terrain gap in Lyndeborough, New Ipswich, & Rindge. I've included a second map for southern NH to show the elevation sensitivity in greater detail. Based on the same orographic processes, **I've decreased amounts to 1-2""""** in the Upper CT River Valley from Woodsville through Strafford.

**I've increased amounts to 8-12""""** for the northern Monadnock Region through Mt. Sunapee, the lower Merrimack Valley through Bow, & hilly areas in eastern NH through Barnstead. I am not convinced that  snow will be able to efficiently pile up in at the Seacoast along the coastal front, where low-level temperatures are abysmal. Those locations will be held at 4-8"""", with consideration for an upgrade to 8-12"""" if forecast confidence increases.

The winter-like stretch of weather continues into the week ahead, with a hemispheric pattern akin to what we'd see in February and subsequently very unusual for April. This configuration is slated to form a powerful, multi-day, high impact nor'easter across New Hampshire. If the previous 2-3 storms weren't tricky enough, this storm is even more complex. I'm already fielding questions about what lies ahead, so let's take a important, methodical dive together.

**The 30,000 Foot View**

1. Confidence is increasing in this storm being the most impactful we've experienced this winter; **do not underestimate winter weather Wednesday evening-early Friday**!
2. **Get comfortable with a lack of confidence in certain areas of this forecast**. Massive uncertainty with forecast storm track continues, based on a complex evolution between numerous cores of strong upper-level spin (vorticity) and the formation of a Rex block. *Numerical model performance is consistently at its poorest in these regimes*.

**What We Know**

1. **Timing:** Wintry precipitation will overspread from WSW to ENE afternoon Wednesday, be at its worst overnight Wednesday through Thursday, then taper off early Friday morning. This will fluctuate a bit in the coming day or two.
2. **Wind:** The surface low will undergo bombogenesis, or explosive deepening of the pressure center. The pressure-gradient response will induce the formation of a powerful low-level jet directly over NH on Thursday. Persistent, strong wind gusts are increasingly likely in the Monadnock Region, White Mountains, all of SE NH, & the Seacoast.
3. **Visibility:** The combination of strong winds & heavy snow rates will likely lead to **near-blizzard or blizzard conditions around both commutes Thursday**. This will be exacerbated by the wet snow consistency, which will allow huge aggregates to stick together.

**What We Don't Know**

1. **Storm Track:** At this time, there is a massive, borderline hilarious 425 mile spread in primary low track between the core of our """"big three"""" global ensemble forecast systems (American, Canadian, & European). A bifurcation in outcomes has emerged **before** the low moves east into Nova Scotia:
   1. **Inside Cut:** The primary low takes a massive cut inland into New England or portions of Massachusetts Bay before sliding east.

The winter - like stretch of weather continue into the week ahead, with a hemispheric pattern akin to what we'd see in February and subsequently very unusual for April. This configuration be slate to form a powerful, multi - day, high impact nor'easter across New Hampshire. If the previous 2 - 3 storm weren't tricky enough, this storm be even much complex. I'm already field question about what lie ahead, so let's take a important, methodical diva together. * * The 30,000 Foot View * * 1.

The pressure - gradient response will induce the formation of a powerful low - level jet directly over NH on Thursday. Persistent, strong wind gust be increasingly likely in the Monadnock Region, White mountain, all of SE NH, & the Seacoast. 3. * * Visibility: * * The combination of strong wind & heavy snow rate will likely lead to * * near - blizzard or blizzard condition around both commute Thursday * *. This will be exacerbate by the wet snow consistency, which will allow huge aggregate to stick together. * * What We Don't Know * * 1. * * Storm Track: * * At this time, there be a massive, borderline hilarious 425 mile spread in primary low track between the core of our "" "" big three "" "" global ensemble forecast system ( American, Canadian, & European ).

I picked a town 15 min outside of Portland. Quiet, no traffic, nobody flipping the jersey state bird, and not one horn blown. Had no problem finding work. Food scene is actually dynamite, not the pizza or bagels though.

But the housing crisis is a thing up here just like jersey.  Old ass houses going for well over there intended value because all the Massholes came up and scooped up second homes for cash. Sounds pretty familiar (i.e. NY'rs coming to NJ).

But what really got me was the sense of humor up here. Or lack there-of. No sarcasm (jerseys second language), dry, vanilla/plain type people. Almost """"too"""" boring. Kind but not nice, is a thing up here. It was easier to make friend with transplants than it was actual locals.

The pay scale is not that great up here also. I'm in construction and it seems like they're about 10-15 yrs behind on the rest of the nation. Portland and surrounding towns are charging Hoboken prices to live here. So if you want to get a house under 400k, on at least an acre, you have to look almost an hr plus away from portland. Which puts you in the middle of trailer city. Property taxes aren't as much but pretty dam close.

Also the amount of racism is astounding.  2nd week up here some kkk group marched through Portland and noone did or said anything. Then the lewiston shooting. A shooting on 95 a couple months prior to lewiston.

The 1968 election of President Nixon was meant to bring an end to the war that was still raging two years later. In a decision meant to end the war in Vietnam from a supposed position of strength, on April 31st, 1970, Nixon ordered the invasion of Cambodia on the pretext of communist supply lines and troop movements through the Cambodian side of the jungle.

>However, to the public, this invasion seemed like an escalation. For the days of May 1st to May 3rd, protests on college campuses erupted in opposition to the violation of Cambodian sovereignty and the continuation, and now, expansion of the Vietnam war. In response to social unrest, on May 4th the Ohio National Guard was called to Kent State, killing four students.

>At UNM, students were also protesting. Jane Fonda, a famous anti-war protester, visited UNM campus to help students organize. She joined students on Tuesday May 5th for the march on Heady’s house at midnight. On Wednesday May 6th, there was a strike of mourning dedicated to the victims of Kent state by both students and faculty. Ferrel Heady, the President of UNM, wondered if closing the campus would be necessary considering a violent protest that had broken out at the flagpole at the Stanford Street entrance the same day, resulting in the stabbings of three students. In response, at about 3pm, students occupied the Student Union Building due to the feeling of having their voice being censured.

>On Friday, May 8th, in a conference call among regents with President Heady in attendance, the Regents themselves agreed that the correct course of action would be to file in court for the removal of the students from the SUB, citing threats of damage to the building. However, later in the day, the Regents and President Heady came to an agreement allowing the SUB to continue to be open with the protesters, however a miscommunication ensued with law enforcement, so they never got the message.

>At 8:45am, William Orzen went to the Student Union and informed the protesters the Regents intent to file for removal of the students An hour and fifteen minutes later, having had advance notice from the conference call, Heady went to the Union in order to ask the protestors to leave before the court filing took place. After Heady’s plea, the protestors debated staying, with a large contingent of 300 protestors leaving to instead march on the Federal Building in downtown Albuquerque.

>However, in defiance, 131 protesters stayed, and at the time of 6pm, State Police Chief Martin Vigil called up the National Guard that was placed on alert by Governor Cargo earlier in the week.  Vigil then entered the union, read aloud the order of the court, and then ordered the National Guard to clear out the occupiers. All 131 protestors were arrested, along with 11 individuals who were bayonetted, one of whom included KOB correspondent Bill Norlander.

>At the hands of Professor Leonardo Garcia-Bunuel, who was the Physician on duty, and his team of medical student volunteers and ex medics from Vietnam, they gave the 11 injured participants care in a makeshift trauma unit in the Zimmerman Library. The melee in the SUB was so chaotic that the stretcher bearers were almost bayonetted themselves.

>The following week all 131 occupants were charged with Criminal Trespassing, with 20 of them additionally charged with contempt of court for violating a court order.

>The following day, on Saturday, May 9th, an emergency Faculty Senate Meeting was called to order by President Heady at 1:38pm. In an atypical four hour and 52-minute session, the faculty were struggling with how to resolve the situation on campus. Most faculty supported and made motions to denounce the deployment of the guard. Some argued about issuing a denouncement of the student occupiers who defied the order, some would’ve rather cheered at their courage.

Around this time a year ago, it was about midnight and I was in the process of stuffing all of my earthly possessions into my mini SUV with a mission to leave Texas and never come back.  stopped at a gas station in my hometown for some coffee, a Red Bull, and a five hour energy. EMT license in hand, I set out for a 12 and a half hour drive due west to begin a new life in a new place with new people. 800 some-odd miles later, I landed in Albuquerque exhausted but with a goal to become a New Mexican and eventually a firefighter. I stayed at the motel 6 off of Carlisle and would begin a 9 month long stint as an EMT with a very well known ambulance service in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County where I got to see the issues that afflict this state in a visceral way. I rented a room out of someone’s house in ABQ for a couple of months as a place to rest my head on the weekdays and spent hundreds of dollars traveling New Mexico.

Since that fateful day, I have visited all 33 counties of our beautiful state. I moved to Santa Fe when everyone told me it would be too expensive. I’ve fallen in love with the sunsets, weather, and ephemeral quiet that coats the landscape when you get away from the urban areas. I’ve visited the museums of my new forever city of Santa Fe. I’ve made social connections in every corner of the state who love this place just as much as I do. And most salient of all, I joined the county fire department here in Santa Fe where I’m gainfully employed and set to graduate from the academy in March.

Moral of the story: when I had to leave NM due to the economic and health consequences of the pandemic, I wasn’t sure when I would return. I spent hours staring at the ceiling and looking out of the window at a dead end job at a convenience store pining to come back to what I like to call “The beautiful Mosaic” that is the Land of Enchantment. A leap of faith to get my EMT cert and come back to the place that learned me how to become a man, to be responsible, and to think about what’s really important in life has paid off in ways that I’m not even fully able to articulate. This place is a dream, and sometimes I have to pinch myself to remind myself that my dream of becoming a real, full-time New Mexican has now become my reality. This place has always and will always be etched on my soul and the only way I’ll leave again is in a pine box. If there’s anything I’ve learned over the last year, it’s this:

Crescit eundo

We will grow as we go because New Mexico has never quit on us. May our progress reach as high as Wheeler Peak and may our love for our home be as vast as the high plains! Take care everyone, I’ll keep you posted.","Around this time a year ago, it be about midnight and I be in the process of stuff all of my earthly possession into my mini SUV with a mission to leave Texas and never come back. stop at a gas station in my hometown for some coffee, a Red Bull, and a five hour energy.

I want to share a family-owned a authentic cheap Fuzhounese restaurant that has been around at Chinatown for over 20 years now. It's frustrating to see how my parents are keeping this business alive while funding me for college. We are located at 67 E Broadway New York, NY 10002 and my recommendations are

Wonton Soup $3.25

Peanut Noodles $3.50

Fried Taro Cake $1.50

Potato Meet ball $5

If you're ever near Chinatown please drop by! It's less than $10 per person and it would be the most authentic Fuzhounese food!

Edited - thank you so much everyone for the love and support. Unfortunately I will be leaving in a week for college so I wouldn’t be available to create any content. I have reached out to many local organizations and are in contact with some. We truly appreciate the support and please feel free to DM me if you have any questions.

In the future, it might even be worth considering adding more information to these screens, such as whether a line is running on its nighttime schedule or if there are service alerts. Here’s what that could look like, although I think the priority now should be train arrival info.

There are scammers profiting off our crisis here in North Carolina in a highly coordinated effort. They are utilizing a rapidly evolving disinformation campaign to influence public opinion and solicit donations of money. There are entire networks of [scam websites](https://www.manganesexenergycorp.com/manganese-a-substitute-for-lithium-ion-batteries/), [scam charities](https://americanyellowcross.org/MOBILE/Partners.aspx), and fake social media profiles dedicated to this effort. Not to sound alarmist or conspiracy theorist myself, but there's a non zero chance this may be a cyber attack from a foreign nation. 

If so, our nation is being targeted in the midst of a major national disaster. They are targeting well meaning individuals who want to help victims of the disaster. They are advocating for civil unrest and calling for violence against the first responders deployed in the disaster area. 

Do not travel to Western North Carolina with the intentions of attacking your fellow Americans.

If you hear someone talking about traveling to WNC with the intent to cause harm or create civil unrest, notify authorities immediately.

Know that the goal of this apparent attack, is to maximize the suffering and death of Americans affected by what may be the worst natural disaster in US history.

If you come across donation links for hurricane victims on social media, specifically Facebook, verify that the profile who originally posted the link is a real person. Ask a close family member for a second opinion. Do not donate money to these pages. Report the profile for: Spam or Violence. Select the option to send the report to Meta. 

If you have donated money to one of these scam links, dispute it with your bank. Your financial information has likely been compromised.

If you are unsure about a website or need a second opinion to verify your sources, feel free to reach out.

Challenge misinformation online wherever you see it. Be a calm voice of reason. State facts. Try not to get too heated. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous.

**1. Don’t evacuate because the government is going to steal your land to mine lithium!**

That’s not a thing. Hypothetically, if the government DID want your land (they don’t), they wouldn't need all these layers of conspiracy to take it. They can invoke eminent domain and must compensate you for the property. This is basic constitutional law (5th amendment). Again, that isn't happening. Anyone telling folks not to evacuate doesn’t have their best interests at heart.

**2. FEMA is confiscating/destroying/hoarding supplies and turning away help.**

They’re telling people where to drop off supplies and asking untrained individuals not to self deploy. Going out there alone without training or equipment makes you a liability no matter how good your intentions are.

**3. The government isn’t helping!**

The government is helping. They have been since day 1. The best trained rescue technicians in the nation are working around the clock. National Guard is there. 82nd Airborne is there. Air Force & Civil Air Patrol. NC Highway Patrol. FEMA. All the politicians have come and gone. The reason why it’s taking so long to reach those in need is because this is a MASSIVE disaster spanning hundreds of miles, several states, and millions of people. So far, this is the 3rd largest mobilization of federal resources behind 9/11 and Katrina.

**4. We need to rise up against FEMA!**

Why would anyone want to harm the people who are helping? Why would anyone advocate for any act that would disrupt search and rescue operations? FEMA is not our enemy and never has been. They're average folks just like us who genuinely want to help others.

**5. Fort Liberty is being told to stand down. They're denying soldiers leave**

82nd Airborne has been deployed to WNC. Soldiers were likely told they could not use personal leave to self deploy.

UPDATE: I’ve been informed: “Leave is being allowed, but local (within geographical region) only IF that person is in an alert status. Otherwise, they're free to request leave.”

**6. Federal officials ordered Chimney Rock to be bulldozed**

Never happened. [Debunked by the town.](https://www.wcnc.com/article/weather/hurricane/helene/chimney-rock-bulldozed-helene/275-54741b10-7482-4116-ac38-98bff585b6e6)

**7. FEMA is running out of money because Kamala spent it all on housing illegal migrants**

North Carolina, it is simply beyond comprehension that you can support a man who has gone out of his way to do further harm to your storm ravaged communities; he doesn't give a damn about the pain his constant lying provokes!

It's plain to see his lies are meant to manipulate, to deceive, and if he can convince you through his duplicity that your own government is working against you, then that will fulfill the lust for power that drives him.

He claims he has policies that will cure America's ills, yet he never divulges any real policy, Rather, in his rallies he concentrates on spreading fear, causing division, and trying to manipulate through terror tactics by taking your attention from the real issue.

Listen to his words, do you really believe any of them? And if you see the absurdity now, consider whether he'll ever follow through on his promises.

Look at this -- boldface mine.



""""Communities across the Southeast, most notably in North Carolina, have spent the last several weeks trying to recover from Hurricane Helene and its aftermath. It was against this backdrop that **Donald Trump** visited the Tar Heel State two weeks ago and pursued a radical idea: Maybe, the former president said, he could advance his own interests by **brazenly lying about the governmental response** to the deadly storm. **State and local officials, including plenty of Republicans,** asked him to **stop deceiving** the public, but he ignored the appeals — even as evidence emerged that **Trump’s lies were having an adverse impact** on the response to the crisis.

It was, by some measures, a genuine **election-season scandal:** The GOP nominee for the nation’s highest office saw **devastated communities and human suffering,** which inspired **Trump to repeatedly lie about the heartbreaking circumstances,** hoping it would advance **his quest for power.** Two weeks later, he did it again. NBC News reported that the former president returned to North Carolina, where he “again **made the false claim that FEMA had no money to help victims in the hurricane-stricken area because it was spending funds on migrants.”**

As he’s done for weeks, Trump appeared to conflate two completely separate funds to paint a **misleading picture**. FEMA has **dedicated disaster relief money that cannot be used for other purposes,** and it was separately tasked by Congress in 2022 to disseminate money from Customs and Border Protection to help communities that received influxes of migrants. “They spent a lot of money on bringing illegal migrants. ... They don’t have any money for the people who live here,” **Trump said, despite reality.** “They’ve spent it on illegal migrants.”

**He was, of course, lying —** or more to the point, he was echoing previous lies, which he knows have been discredited, but which he continued to repeat in the hopes that it’ll benefit him personally.

Reminded that these and related conspiratorial lives have led to threats against FEMA workers in the area, Trump expressed relative indifference. “I think you have to let people know how they’re doing,” he told reporters. “If they’re doing a poor job, are we not supposed to say it?” I’m not in a position to say whether Trump actually believes his lies, or whether he knows he’s peddling nonsense. But either way, the consequences of his dangerous lies are the same.

To be sure, I’m mindful of the broader circumstances: North Carolina is a highly competitive battleground state, and the latest polling suggests he’s effectively tied with Vice President Kamala Harris in the state. It’s hardly surprising that the Republican has concluded that he’ll say whatever he has to say, regardless of accuracy or propriety, to get ahead.

But there is a risk of a backlash. If you’re an on-the-fence North Carolinian, unsure which candidate to support, and **one candidate comes to your state to lie about the response to a deadly natural disaster,** would you be more or less likely to vote for that candidate?

Trump could’ve simply made an appearance and expressed his support. He instead decided to take a chance by peddling easily discredited nonsense.

No, Biden didn’t take FEMA relief money to use on migrants — but Trump did

Donald Trump falsely accuses President Biden of redirecting disaster funds, a budget maneuver Trump himself approved in 2019.

“The Harris-Biden administration says they don’t have any money [for hurricane relief]. … They spent it all on illegal migrants. … They stole the FEMA money just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them.”

— Former president Donald Trump, remarks at a campaign rally in Saginaw, Mich., Oct. 3 Trump has been trying to weaponize the Hurricane Helene relief efforts, accusing the Biden administration of failing to provide adequate assistance. As part of his critique, he claims that there is no money available for hurricane relief because it was spent already to handle the surge of migrants at the southern border.

“They stole the FEMA money just like they stole it from a bank,” Trump charged, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, adding in the additional falsehood that Vice President Kamala Harris wants illegal immigrants to vote for her. As we have explained many times before, this would be against the law and there is no evidence to support this claim. Trump’s claims have been echoed by his supporters, such as billionaire Elon Musk. But Trump is completely wrong. ✅

Follow Fact-checking politicians

Even though Trump was once president, he still appears to have little clue about the appropriations process. What’s even richer is that when he was president, he did exactly what he claims Biden did — take money from FEMA’s disaster fund to fund migrant programs at the southern border.

The Facts

FEMA is part of the Department of Homeland Security. On Wednesday, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters: “We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting. FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.” He emphasized there was plenty of money to deal with the current disaster. “We are meeting the moment,” he said, adding: “We have the immediate needs right now. On a continuing resolution, we have funds, but that is not a stable source of supply, if you will.”

Congress, as part of a short-term spending bill, recently provided $20 billion to the FEMA disaster relief fund. But Mayorkas noted: “That doesn’t speak about the future and the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that these extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and severity, and we have to be funded for the sake of the American people. This is not a political issue.”

In other words, Trump falsely claimed that there is no money left for Hurricane Helene survivors. That’s the opposite of what Mayorkas said.

“FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,” FEMA spokeswoman Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X. “As FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has said, she has the full authority to spend against the President’s budget, but we’re not out of hurricane season yet so we need to keep a close eye on it. We may need to go back into immediate needs funding and we will be watching it closely.” So how does Trump link this to migrants? A Trump campaign spokesman pointed to FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program, which gives grants to local governments and nonprofits to take care of undocumented immigrants. Congress boosted the budget from $360 million in fiscal year 2023 to $650 million in fiscal year 2024. The program’s 2023 annual report says it provides shelter, such as hotel/motel services, food and transportation, including plane tickets up to $700 a person. As we said, Congress appropriated this money, just as it did the disaster fund. There’s no evidence that any money from the disaster fund was used to help migrants.

“These claims are completely false,” DHS said in a statement Thursday night. “As Secretary Mayorkas said, FEMA has the necessary resources to meet the immediate needs associated with Hurricane Helene and other disasters. The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA’s disaster-related authorities or funding streams.”

Trump has a habit of assuming other politicians act in the same way as he would. So we wondered why he would accuse Biden of raiding the FEMA disaster fund to handle undocumented migrants.

It turns out that’s because he did this! In 2019, the Trump administration, in the middle of hurricane season, told Congress that it was taking $271 million from DHS programs, including $155 million from the disaster fund, to pay for immigration detention space and temporary hearing locations for asylum seekers who have been forced to wait in Mexico. “The U.S. is facing a security and humanitarian crisis on the Southern border,” the administration said in its notice that it was redirecting the funds. The monthly reports issued by the FEMA disaster fund show $38 million was plucked and given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in August that year — just before the prime storm period of September and October. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about Trump’s actions in 2019.

The Pinocchio Test

Trump falsely claims FEMA has run out of disaster money — and then falsely says that’s because money instead was spent on migrants. There is no evidence the Biden administration spent FEMA disaster money on migrants. Rather, that’s what Trump did.

He earns Four Pinocchios.

105 heading towards Boone was closed, so we tried heading South in 221 to Marion. That was also closed off. We were going to try 181 to Morganton, but I found out later that was also closed.

I just returned from a trip I took with my parents and fiancé to Spruce Pine. We stayed at The Skyline Village Inn.

The first night we were there, my fiancé and I were getting a drink at the bar. A man approached us, his name is Matt. He was not a guest at the Inn, but he followed us and another woman who was a guest at the Inn into the game room (the bar closes at 10 there, and anyone who is not a paying guest is supposed to leave when the bar closes.) 

Apparently he is a regular at the bar at the Skyline Village Inn. At one point he stated he lived 2 miles away from the inn.

After following us to the game room, he was making repulsive comments about raping women - and thought it was funny. 

As a woman who has been raped twice in my life, I finally had enough, and told him to shut up and leave. He got in my face, and I told him if he took a step closer to me, I would pepper spray him.
After I said that, he said he had a gun on him, and if I sprayed him, he would shoot me. 

I ran to my parents room to let them know the situation, and when I came back to the game room, he was gone. I only have a picture of the back of him - but he was about 5’9”, balding, wearing rectangular glasses, and had a beer gut.

I called the owner of the property, Kevin, and he was very helpful. He told me to contact the non emergency line- but unfortunately, there was no answer. So I called 911. 

Two sheriffs came very quickly and I gave them the best description I could. Unfortunately, since he did not actually flash his gun at me, I could not make an official police report.

The owners of the inn - Kevin and Tamara - know exactly who this man is. Kevin told me he comes to the bar to pick up women. Tamara told me she has always had the creeps from him - the exact feeling I had when he starting talking to us at the bar.

Please watch out for this man. Unfortunately I have no idea what kind of car he drives, just that he’s a local.

We’re looking to move to North Carolina from North Sentinel Island and wanted to know more about where we should move.

A little bit about us: I work in tech as someone who adds malware to computer software while my wife sells Christmas ornaments from March to September. She suffers from quaererephobia (fear of search bars) and I have a severe pollen allergy. We make a combined salary of $2,700. 

What we’re looking for: We’re hoping to live half an hour from the mountains and the beach. Ideally, we’d like a three story house with wrap around porch and original crown molding. Lots of bedrooms would be a plus as we plan on having 11 children over the next four years. I don’t know if this is possible but are there any places with just a ton of breweries and nothing else? That would be a big plus. 

Things to do: Just normal things like hiking, poetry, yelling at children skateboarding in parks, pottery, brewery tours, and complaining about how many transplants have moved to North Carolina. 

Is all this possible or is this a fantasy? We would hire a real estate agent but that requires a Google search and again, the quaererephobia. Thank you advance!","hello you all!

Sept. 20, 2024


Governor DeWine,

I appreciate your deep commitment to the people of Ohio, and your pride in Springfield is evident. You have shown a strong connection to the community and have rightly celebrated the diversity and work ethic that drives Springfield’s resurgence. However, as someone who leads this great state, you are faced with a profound challenge: to uphold not just the political alignment of your party, but the moral responsibility you bear as governor.

While you acknowledge the harm caused by the divisive rhetoric of former President Trump and Senator JD Vance, your continued support for them undercuts the very values you champion. Trump and Vance’s ongoing attacks, which vilify legal immigrants and inflame tensions, are damaging not only to Springfield but to the very fabric of our state. These migrants, as you eloquently pointed out, are legally here, contributing to the economy, and striving for a better life as Ohioans. Yet, they are being used as pawns in a cynical political game, one that has real consequences for the safety and well-being of Ohio’s citizens.

You are correct to highlight the Biden administration’s failures on immigration, but allowing Trump and Vance’s dangerous rhetoric to overshadow that debate only fuels division and perpetuates harm. In fact, this rhetoric is directly responsible for the vitriol, the threats, and the fear that now permeates Springfield—an Ohio city you deeply cherish.

As governor, your duty to protect the people of Ohio must transcend party loyalty. Your leadership should be guided by what is right, not by what is politically convenient. Condemning the actions of those who threaten the stability and safety of our communities, regardless of party, is not just an act of courage—it is an obligation.

Now is the time to stand up against the forces that are stoking hatred and division in Ohio. It is time to reject the harmful narratives perpetuated by Trump and Vance and to lead with the integrity, responsibility, and compassion that the people of Ohio deserve. Your legacy will not be measured by the politicians you supported, but by the leadership you demonstrated in moments of crisis.

The people of Ohio, especially those in Springfield, need you to rise above the noise and reaffirm your commitment to the values that make this state great. They need you to lead not as a Republican, but as their governor.","In response to: I ’ be the Republican Governor of Ohio. Here be the Truth About Springfield.

This suggests that private schools in Oklahoma may have more resources, better academic standards, and higher teacher quality compared to public schools, which often struggle with underfunding, larger class sizes, and other systemic issues  .

The divide could be attributed to the fact that private schools typically rely on tuition and donations, allowing them to attract more experienced teachers, provide better facilities, and maintain smaller class sizes. In contrast, public schools are dependent on state funding, which in Oklahoma has been historically low, contributing to the poor outcomes seen in standardized test scores, graduation rates, and other public education metrics .

This situation highlights the broader issue of inequality in educational opportunities, where wealthier families may afford to send their children to private schools, leaving public schools with fewer resources to serve a more diverse and often disadvantaged population.

Oregon's HB-4002, which Gov. Kotek has announced she will soon sign, is re-criminalizing personal possession of all drugs, including psychedelics, even though backlash to decriminalization has focused almost exclusively on fentanyl, opioids, and meth.

This is a very strange and consequential oversight, it seems like lawmakers simply weren't interested in crafting a more nuanced bill that would have left psychedelics decriminalized while addressing concerns about the fentanyl situation, and had to rush things through a shortened legislative session.

HB-4002 has been widely described “this very precise amendment that’s only going to address the problems with Measure 110, which were thought to be opioids and meth,” said Jon Dennis, a lawyer at the Portland-based law firm Sagebrush Law.

There are no op-eds being written about tripping hippies filling public spaces in grand displays of love and cosmic beatitude. The streets are not littered with acid blotter paper or mushroom caps. Psychonauts aren’t seeking out encounters with DMT entities in public parks. No argument for recriminalizing psychedelics has been made, and yet, they’re being swept into a recriminalization bill by the debate around opioids.

Instead, the amendment re-criminalizes all drugs, setting up psychedelics to become an unintended casualty of Oregon's opioid crisis.","[ Full article here. ] ( https: / / www. vox. com / future - perfect / 24102102 / psychedelic - oregon - opioid - crisis - decriminalization - war - drug - fentanyl - house - bill-4002 ) Oregon's HB-4002, which Gov.

It did not legalize:

Selling drugs

Public use

Theft

Assault

Public defecation

Or any of the other crimes people are attributing to 110. The cops simply stopped enforcing those laws re:the homeless in order to exacerbate the situation, in retaliation for us decriminalizing drugs, so they could do as they are now, and say """"see, legalizing possession didnt work"""", then point to their own handiwork as proof.

Looked from my window and saw two guys dragging a coyote at the forests edge. 

No one is allowed to hunt here because it’s farm land and they were right next to our livestock. 

I went outside in my pajamas and confronted them. They claimed to have permission from my passed on relative, who they knew passed on 10 years ago. 

They kept claiming they were 150 yards away, but I saw them clear as day and they still tried to lie, which made me livid. I pressed them and they started rattling off that they hunt here “all the time”, which is creepy, but never in my life has someone shot that close to the house and to believe the first time it happens is by two grown men I’ve never seen before and no one knows. And albeit, I’m tall, I’m a petite woman. 

I ended up calling the state police just to hear them say “well because you don’t have any no trespassing signs then there’s nothing I can do… and they are claiming to have permission so I can’t cite them or arrest them.” I reiterated that their permission was granted 17 years ago by a family member who died 10 years ago and there’s no way to prove it; the land is fenced farm land with very little woodland that isn’t accessible by road and they had to walk next to the house to get there; that I had no clue how long they’d been outside of my house and how they would’ve been able to watch me through the windows from where they were. Creepy 🤢. The state trooper stuck to saying they hadn’t done anything illegal. 

So, unless you have a no trespassing posted it’s legal for others to use your property however they please! And I guess unprovable word of mouth from someone who passed on is enough permission to hunt your land, as well! They can even shoot in your safety zone! Who knew!?

- I walked the whole two-ish minutes out to where they were and found their tracks and a shotgun shell. They were posted up 130 yards from the house and they shot INTO the safety zone making them a nice 87 yards away when I saw them dragging the coyote.

What gets me is there are so many places to hunt in the pa wilds (central pa) and they choose my backyard, on a Friday morning, to “do me a favor.” The coyotes are actually less dangerous than they potentially were. 

Additionally, I’m not a hunter. I never have been. However, I respect people’s decision to. The issue here is two strangers sitting outside my house with loaded guns and I have no clue they’re there until they used them. I think we all can agree that doesn’t seem right. 

- TL;DR: hunters trespassed and hunted in the safety zone at night/early morning. No warning. No idea who they were. Cops couldn’t do anything because the hunters mentioned permission from a passed on (10 yrs) family member and we didn’t have a no trespassing sign. Silly me! So, PSA, better post up. 

EDIT: we are putting signage and purple paint up. The big issue is how close strangers used firearms next to our house. A backyard should be obvious to not hunt in. Especially, with such loose and unprovable permissions. 

I have nothing against hunting. I want to make that clear. 

Edit 2: I can’t keep up with the replies. Thank you to all who chimed in! I appreciate everyone’s advice. 

Edit 3: I’m not by definition “petite” because I’m over 5’4”. So, strike that from the record. I apologize to those I’ve offended with mention of my size and gender. 

However, my reality is this: if I needed to defend myself, like many other people, I’m acutely aware of the disadvantage I have because of my build. Thankfully nothing happened. I still shouldn’t have been forced into that situation to begin with to find that out though. No one should. 

Update: Whatever the gaming commission is getting paid PAY THEM MORE. They’re some nice people. I’ll update more soon!

Beyond 2016 and 2020. Trump’s presence on the roadsides is frankly overwhelming, with countless lawns, barns, and fields plastered with his name in bright, bold letters—like several signs stapled to each individual tree along some public roadways. In some areas, private individuals have framed large signs in wood to shore them up. Harris, on the other hand, barely makes an appearance, her few signs standing like lonely sentinels amid a sea of red.

It’s not just the signage, flags, bumper stickers, or the makeshift Halloween decorations depicting things happening to Harris and Biden that’s alarming. Sidewalk marches, unofficial-Trump rallies, impromptu and organized alike, are happening with more frequency and fervor than any gatherings I’ve seen for Harris. This goes beyond the usual small-town pride. There’s a palpable anger—a miasma of bitterness—that permeates the air in these areas, seemingly directed at anyone who dares oppose Trump. Disturbingly, this has coincided with an increase in vandalism targeting private property where Harris signs are displayed, the kind of behavior that suggests more than just political disagreement—it’s veering into intimidation.

If you live in or near Pittsburgh, the Lehigh Valley, Wyoming Valley, Reading, or Philadelphia and its suburbs, you may not have witnessed this firsthand. The more urban, “blue” enclaves are not representative of the larger picture. The stark reality is that rural Pennsylvania is mobilizing for Trump like never before, and it’s going to take a historic turnout from the cities to counterbalance this surge. If we want to prevent a repeat of 2016, it’s crucial for these urban and suburban voters to show up in unprecedented numbers. Because make no mistake—outside the comforting bubble of blue, there’s an entirely different political climate that’s preparing to go all in.

Here are some simple guidelines:

- Right on red is voluntary not mandatory. If someone in front of you isn't taking it, they may have a reason. Take your fucking horn and shove it all the way up your ass. In fact, get all of your family members, have them grab their horns, and shove all of them all the way up your ass.

- Right on red is the literal last priority at an intersection that is allowed to go. This means your fucking right on red is not more important than pedestrians, cross traffic, someone taking a left with a left arrow, again pedestrians, did I fucking mention pedestrians you fucking pieces of shit?

- The stop line at an intersection still applies if you have a right on red. That means a right on red isn't an invitation to nose half your fucking car into the intersection and also block the crosswalk at the expense of cross traffic including cyclists and OH YEAH FUCKING PEDESTRIANS YOU FUCKING IMBECILES.

- Right on red requires you to STOP, then check the the road is clear (including bikes and yes once mother fucking again, pedestrians) and then proceed. It's not a """"fuck yeah I have a right on red I can plow forward with no abandon I am the coolest dude on the planet.""""

In my Providence life I have been hit on my bike 3 times and twice as a pedestrian. I have also had about 5 close calls as a pedestrian (like where I had to take evasive action or rap on somebody's car with my cane to let them know I was in the crosswalk). All but one were right on red fucking idiots, including yesterday. I am being profane to be funny but I think maybe traffic engineers should stop using right on red as a crutch for their shitty throughput goals.

Is it just Warwick? Is that the issue? 

I moved over here and the “I will come to a dead stop and blinky-blinky my lights at you so you can turn left in front of me” problem is so freaking bad … I’m clearly losing it.

Coming home from my commute to Boston (bad enough) yesterday, I was on Warwick Ave, my blinker on, patiently waiting to turn left. A car comes to a dead stop and starts blinking at me to turn. I will not turn. Why? Because everyone in the far lane is still cruising along. *I will wait for the rest of my life rather than turn under these conditions.* 

So, I’m gesturing for her to just keep driving and she gives up and throws her hands in the air - AT ME - and moves forward.

Then - in tandem - two black trucks stop side by side and start blinking their lights. THEY HAD NO TRAFFIC COMING BEHIND THEM. Had they just kept moving, I could have turned within 3.2 seconds.

Was there a time in RI’s history when left turns were banned? When people were stranded on roadways for months? Is that why this behavior exists? Generational trauma? 

Anyway, let’s agree on a hand signal. Not the middle finger because they are trying to be nice, so we don’t need to be mean. Not double middle fingers because I need to keep one hand on the wheel. Not a salute because they will think they are *the* Lil General. I’m leaning towards sticking my left hand out the window and giving a big thumbs down. Seems very European. 

Thoughts?

**1. “Don’t evacuate because the government is going to steal your land!”**

That’s not a thing. Hypothetically, if the government DID want your land (they don’t), they wouldn't need all these layers of conspiracy to take it. They can invoke eminent domain and must compensate you for the property. This is basic constitutional law (5th amendment). Again, that isn't happening. Anyone telling folks not to evacuate doesn’t have their best interests at heart.

**2. FEMA is confiscating/destroying/hoarding supplies and turning away help.**

They’re telling people where to drop off supplies and asking untrained individuals not to self deploy. Going out there alone without training or equipment makes you a liability no matter how good your intentions are.

**3. The government isn’t helping!**

The government is helping. They have been since day 1. The best trained rescue technicians in the nation are working around the clock. National Guard is there. 82nd Airborne is there. Air Force & Civil Air Patrol. NC Highway Patrol. FEMA. All the politicians have come and gone. The reason why it’s taking so long to reach those in need is because this is a MASSIVE disaster spanning hundreds of miles, several states, and millions of people. So far, this is the 3rd largest mobilization of federal resources behind 9/11 and Katrina.

**4. We need to rise up against FEMA!**

Why would anyone want to harm the people who are helping? Why would anyone advocate for any act that would disrupt search and rescue operations? FEMA is not our enemy and never has been. They're average folks just like us who genuinely want to help others.

**5. """"Fort Liberty is being told to stand down. They're denying soldiers leave""""**

82nd Airborne has been deployed to WNC. Soldiers were likely told they could not use personal leave to self deploy. Considering the situation in the Middle East, they're probably not granting personal leave at all right now. This is common sense.

Those are the most common examples I've been seeing. I'll update this post as needed to bring awareness to any other false narratives that emerge.

Watching Trump’s rally in North Charleston was a truly frustrating experience for me.  Sure, some things he said were accurate, but interspersed throughout were one misstatement of fact after another. 

According to Trump, we had “the greatest economy in the history of the world,” till “crooked Joe Biden” came along and destroyed it.  In reality, the economy went downhill Trump’s final year due to the pandemic, which he, in some ways, did a poor job of responding to.  So, Biden didn’t destroy a good economy.  He inherited Trump’s bad economy. 

Secondly, Trump’s economy was not as good as he says it was. Prior to the pandemic, GDP was between 2 and 3 percent, same as it was in 2014 and 2015, and only slightly up from 2016, under Obama.  GDP under Biden was in the same range in 2022, and was actually almost 6 percent in 2021. 

Wages under Trump rose between 3-4 % annually, the same as in Obama’s final year, and they have risen much more dramatically under Biden. 

The unemployment rate went from 4.7% to 3.5% under Trump, but this was a continuation of a trend that had been going on for a long time under Obama.  After the disastrous unemployment rates in Trump’s final year, unemployment in the last two years under Biden has settled back into the 3-4% range. 

Trump has a valid point about inflation under Biden, but he fails to tell his audience that Biden’s stimulus was only partially to blame.  Other factors included pandemic related issues and government spending that occurred during Trump’s time in office.  Trump also fails to inform his audience that inflation has come down dramatically from a high of 9% in mid-2022 to only 3% today. 

At the North Charleston rally, Trump once again touted his tariffs, when in reality his tariffs have not been beneficial to the average American, simply passing on higher costs to consumers. 

Trump criticized Biden’s tax plan, and promised more tax cuts, but failed to tell his audience how he is going to prevent this from ballooning the deficit.  This same kind of thinking of reducing taxes without reducing spending has plagued Republican administrations for decades. 

Trump rightly condemns Biden’s poor handling of the border situation, but ignores the fact that, as U.S. law currently stands, people can show up at the border, claim asylum, and are allowed to stay in the U.S. until their asylum hearing.  Trump wants to fix everything by executive order when legislation is truly needed to solve the problem. 

At the rally, Trump continued to tell his story about people from a South American mental institution coming to America, even though he hasn’t been able to produce any proof of it.  He continued his false claim that he was responsible for the VA Choice Act, when this was actually passed under Obama, and all Trump did was update and expand it with the Mission Act in 2018.

At the North Charleston rally, Trump went on and on about how good his poll numbers are.  If you look at the combined polling, however, the race between Biden and Trump is very close.  Most disingenuous was Trump’s assertion that Nikki Haley’s poll numbers against Biden were terrible, when a number of polls show her beating Biden.

This was only the tip of the iceberg of Trump’s Nikki Haley misrepresentations.  He continued to repeat the falsehood that Nikki Haley supports a 23% national sales tax, when that is not part of her economic platform.  Some years back she floated the idea as part of a flat tax to replace the national income tax. 

Even more laughable was Trump’s claim that Nikki Haley wants to raise the retirement age by 10 years, followed by a completely fake scenario of a retiree finding out at the last minute they still have 11 more years to go till they can retire. 

Most disheartening to me was Trump’s repeating of his completely debunked theory that the Democrats rigged the 2020 election, while failing to tell the audience that he is facing multiple felony counts of election subversion himself.  He accused Biden of being a “threat to democracy,” when he (Trump) went out of his way to overturn the 2020 election. 

Trump, as usual, portrayed all his legal problems as the result of Democrat persecution. Unfortunately, his criminal behavior is on tape for everyone to hear for themselves, and the only reason his election subversion case hasn’t gone to trial is because of his absurd presidential immunity appeals.

In a nutshell, Trump rallies are great entertainment, but voters who want to live in a fact-based universe need to look elsewhere. The rally also raised several questions every Trump voter should ask themselves:

1. Trump claims that he could end the conflict in Ukraine by negotiation.  Does anyone seriously believe Trump could sit down with Putin and get him to give up his aspirations? 

2. Trump’s entire answer to America’s energy needs seems to be “drill baby drill.”  But what about the fact that humanity’s dependence on fossil fuels is harming the environment?  What is his plan to develop clean energy?

3. Trump voters would surely point to falsehoods Biden has told to exonerate Trump.  But, if you believe in honesty in government, how is replacing Biden with Trump going to make things any better?

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A bill that would have consolidated six South Carolina heath care agencies and was overwhelmingly passed by both chambers of the General Assembly died on the session's final day Thursday in a procedural move by a member angry he was mocked by his colleagues.

Republican Rep. Josiah Magnuson has been against the bill from the start, saying it would create a health care czar who could take over like a dictator if there was another pandemic emergency like COVID-19.

So, when the House needed unanimous support to take up the bill one last time minutes before the 5 p.m. Thursday end-of-session deadline, Magnuson objected and stood his ground even as bill sponsor Republican Sen. Tom Davis came over and held a heated conversation with other party members that had many in the chamber stopping to watch and security sergeants hovering nearby.

After the session ended, Magnuson said he was offended that he and his fellow *Freedom Caucus* members — roughly 15 of the most conservative House members — had been mocked all week.

Magnuson said one colleague had a puppet with bright red hair, just like Magnuson, wearing a tin hat with a Freedom Caucus sticker.

He said Davis has had nothing but insulting things to say about the group that often tries to use obstructing tactics to stall bills and social media posts that other Republicans say are ambiguous or misleading to achieve goals outside of what most Republicans in the House want.

“They have basically ridiculed me,” Magnuson said. “They have completely eradicated any credibly they have with me.”

*The bill follows up last year's breakup of the state Department of Health and Environmental Control that spun off the environmental functions.*

The 2024 proposal *would have* created a new Executive Office of Health and Policy. It *would have* combined separate agencies that currently oversee South Carolina's Medicaid program*, help for older people and those with mental health problems, public health and drug and alcohol abuse programs.* The consolidated agency would have come under the governor's cabinet.

Republican Gov. Henry McMaster supported the bill in his State of the State speech. It was a pet project of Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Harvey Peeler and backed by Republican House Speaker Murrell Smith It passed the Senate on a 44-1 vote and the House on a 98-15 vote.

A stunned Davis stormed back in the chamber after the gavel fell and told Peeler what happened. Staffers in both chambers shook their heads.

“I'm interested in delivering good health care options for the people of South Carolina,"""" Davis said. “And we had some people over in the House today that failed the people of South Carolina over petty political differences.”

The bill had a tough slog at times. More conservative senators tried to tack proposals on that would prevent businesses from requiring employees to get vaccines that had not been approved by the federal government — a holdover complaint from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Others didn't like their interpretation that the new director of the bigger health care agency could get nearly unlimited powers to quarantine, require vaccines or arrest people who didn't follow orders in a health care emergency. Supporters of the bill said that couldn't happen.

*The death of the health care bill was considered a win by the Freedom Caucus,* which often feels shut out of the best committee assignments and that their ideas get no traction in committee or the House floor.

Caucus Chairman Republican Rep. Adam Morgan said it was a bad bill from the start.

“Sometimes your bills die,"""" Morgan said. “You play stupid games, win stupid prizes.”

Smith said this kind of move by the Freedom Caucus doesn't help their cause in a chamber where almost all progress comes from working together. He said the bill will continue to be a priority and that the General Assembly returns sooner than some might realize.

“It will be a six-month delay, but I don't think that disrupts anything we are doing,"""" Smith said.

Project 2025 plans to cut Medicaire and Medicaid. If implemented, it plans to jail women who get abortions pills or use contraceptives. (Which their hand was shown when the Republicans denied even a VOTE that would protect access to birth control. I wonder why that is.) 

It wants to outlaw IVF. When using IVF and an embryo is considered a """"person"""" or """"fetal personhood"""" to the Evangelicals. Alabama has already begun the process of eliminating IVF. Why? Because providers fear that """"our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF.""""

It would strip away one of the tenets of our country, seeking asylum. It would deport immigrants through raids. You know?! Like Hitler did with the Jews.

It would give executive power to surveillance on citizens. Which is ALWAYS good if Trump, a sociopath who wants vengeance on his enemies (*cough*Hitler*cough*), gets his hand on that power. Now that the Supreme Court has declared that presidents are above the law, I'm sure nothing bad would happen there (heavvvy sarcasm).

Protesting would be done for. Federal law enforcement would have the power to arrest protestors and journalists. (*cough*Nazi Germany*cough*)

Voting will be all but obsolete. Project 2025 will abuse executive power to interfere in our elections by criminalizing the voting process and damaging fair representation. (*cough*dictatorship*cough*).

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — The South Dakota National Guard will be heading back to the Southern Border this fall, according to Gov. Kristi Noem’s [weekly column](https://news.sd.gov/news?id=news_kb_article_view&sys_id=4092bc751bcc5290f6142062f54bcbc1). 

In her weekly Friday column, Noem said South Dakota guardsmen recently returned from the border where they constructed more than five miles of border wall, fortified 20 miles of border wall and repaired 45 breaches between Del Rio and Eagle Pass, Texas. 

“I spent a day with them helping them build the wall – it wasn’t easy work,” Noem wrote. “They had to clear miles of rough ground in 100-degree heat and Texas humidity before they could get to work on barrier construction. But they were glad to do it in service to our country.” 

Noem said another group of South Dakota National Guard troops will be deployed to the border on a federal activation “later this Fall.” 

“We will continue to do everything we can to mitigate the cartels’ influence here at home,” Noem wrote. 

Noem has sent South Dakota troops to the U.S.-Mexico border more than five times during her term as governor. 

State lawmakers provided $4.2 million to the special emergency and disaster special revenue fund in [House Bill 1061](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24931). ","Dang, if only the republican leader in the country can [ pass a bill ] ( https: / / www. nbcnews. com / politic / congress / senate - republican - block - border - security - bill - campaign - border - chaos - rcna153607 ) to stop the "" "" illegal cartel immigrant "" "" so our hard earn state tax money wouldn't have to go to this.

So now that the powers that be have voted down Farm Bill cannabis products that were widely sold around town…. What is the end outcome for all these shops that opened up? Man if I owned one I would be so upset. It seems to be a huge waste of resources to spend time fighting something that was federally approved. Several entrepreneurs acted on the federal interpretation. Right or wrong, it was within federal guidelines. Now they are being effectively shut down. If it were liquor stores, bars, or video lottery… they would go to bat for you! But hell no! It isn’t associated with crime, domestic abuse, death, or addiction, yet it  gets banned! Crazy. The only legitimate argument I can think of, is youth access. With recreational legalization, you could move all traffic to dispensaries only and have much more control over the distribution. But why cut the legs off of all these business owners, why not work with them in order to establish a competent model? Something is wrong here!

Also, with neighboring states flipping towards legal recreational cannabis, it seems ridiculous to not capitalize on the potential revenue. Save me the health arguments. If legislators cared about health… bars, smoking, and McDonalds would have been illegal decades ago. Unless you are prepared to argue that all bars should close as well, please spare the rhetorical health argument!

So why is it that they continue this archaic road of prohibition? 

The best reason that I can think of for their hypocritical views, is that they would like to continue using it as leverage to oppress and violate the rights of minorities and under privileged. Federal mandates are now gone in relation to these Farm Bill cannabis products and and yet the thoughts of our archaic leaders are to now oppose the federal code and continue to assert their interpretations that allow them to continue using a well known tactic of oppression. 95% of the pot smokers I know in this town are white and employed, but look at the arrest and conviction rate by race and socioeconomic placement… I don’t have to know what it is to know that it is insanely biased and obviously prejudicial…  

A story I’d like to tell people is about the dishwasher at one of the restaurants I worked at in DTSF. He was 20 minutes late for work, and was going to get fired, but explained when he got there, that he had been pulled over by the police. He had been detained for over a half hour and was released with a verbal warning. They accused him of being 5 mph over the speed limit, had him put his hands on the hood of the car while they searched his vehicle. Now, he was a weed smoker… Because this has happened to him so many times, he knew to never have weed in his car. In the one year that he had lived in Sioux Falls, he had been pulled over six times and searched every time! Never had a ticket issued…. He was black, and he had dreads… yes he smoked weed, but so did every other BoH guy working with him… between all of 6 the white BoH guys combined, they hadn’t been pulled over six times in their lives. personally, I had never heard of anyone being pulled over for 5 miles over…  Coincidence? 

Whether of not it is by design, this is how it gets applied. Everybody uses bias to dictate their opinions. Police and leaders are no different, but they need to be. There are so many reasons why this bill should not have passed, but it is clear that our leaders are out of touch with the voters. We literally passed recreational marijuana, and here we are, still playing their games when there are real issues out there.  I mean,  after all we have Kristi Noem vying for NARCOS season 6-  Pine Ridge …. 😆😂🤣

Ever since the abortion ban took place, maternal mortality has been rising. It is estimated that you are 62% more likely to die from being pregnant in a state with abortion restrictions than one without. The CDC has maternal mortality listed by state.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/mmr-2018-2022-state-data.pdf

You can see that Tennessee has the highest probability of death of all states listed at 41.1

The CDC also shows that maternal mortality has been rising from 2018-2022, and has almost doubled.

Why are these women dying? While medical ‘abortion’ is legal. Doctors must prove that you will die if they do not intervene. This means even if a doctor knows that the pregnancy is dangerous, and can cause permanent damage to your organs or death, they have to wait until your organs are actually failing or sepsis occurs before they can treat you.

If your pregnancy is ectopic, and growing in the fallopian tube instead of the womb, the baby can not make it to term. However, you have to wait until the baby has grown large enough for your tube to burst, and even still, until that process has progressed to the point that you are in the process of dying, a doctor can not help you, without risking their medical license, that they worked very hard for, being imprisoned, and charged fines up to $10,000. 

If you miscarry, even if your baby has already died, you have to wait until sepsis occurs before you can be treated. There is a 50% chance that when you miscarry, not everything will come out on it’s own and you will need a D&C. When you are made to wait this long before an abortion procedure can occur, you’re probability of dying is very high.

If your water breaks early, you have to wait until you’re hemorrhaging.

Women are losing their uteruses, developing permanent damage to various organs, and dying. 

A delayed medical abortion can lead to very serious lifelong injuries. You can lose your uterus. You can have permanent heart damage. You can even lose your eyesight. 

Even if you have already given birth, you may need a D&C to remove the remaining placenta. Again, you must wait until it is killing you. 

1 out of every 4 women receives an abortion procedure at some point in their life. If you are 62% more likely to die in states with total bans, I believe the percentage of medical abortions needed is fairly large.

When are we going to acknowledge that abortion is a medical necessity and make pregnancy safe again? How many woman have to lose organs and die? If you had a deadly health condition, would it be acceptable for a doctor to not be able to legally treat you until your ailment had progressed to the point that you are losing your organs and dying?

There are many, many health conditions that cause pregnancy to be unsafe, this problem is common. There are too many young mothers dying and leaving their children behind. I thought Tennessee cared about children and family. Why are we letting these women die?","Hello! Ever since the abortion ban take place, maternal mortality have be rise.

It's so strange to me, because regardless of whatever someone's view on trans people even is, there's no way you can argue that anything going on with trans people is a major part of politics. It doesn't effect the economy, it doesn't effect public education, it doesn't effect climate and energy, it doesn't effect social welfare solutions.

Again, maybe I have a misread on how much this really is an issue of importance, but I do genuinely have a hard time believing it's such an election deciding issue, making the fact that all their marketing budget is spent talking about trans people really fucking weird.

You can't aim to secede and call yourself a patriot. Secetion is short-sighted and not smart. It cuts us off completely from US federal support. Our leadership just asked for federal disaster relief.... so... you wouldn't get it (see Brexit). And they won't even update the power grid. 

You can't be a patriot and only support SOME americans. Our strength comes from us all. """"United we stand, divided we fall"""". Remember?

Your government is supposed to support you, not knock you down and make you weaker. You already paid for it to. Don't let them take it from you. 

They intend to make us dumber. I spent the last few days trying to find stuff to argue against the comparison of Texas to Al Qaeda and guys, it's getting too similar with these people trying to push religion in schools. Religion that actually has no basis in religion. Just extremism...

If you're destabilizing a government, doesn't that make you the enemy??

They block and refuse to allow bills to pass... they are derelict of duty... remove them and replace them with someone who will do their job, not impede progress and won't hold our country hostage.

They are taking away our rights we fought so hard for. Many died for these laws/rights. WTF are we doing?!","Texas, I'm tire.

**Trump Failed Us**

- Trump's """"Crimson Contagion"""" was basically a pandemic disaster drill that oddly took place in 2019 right before the pandemic.  Even after Obama left him a playbook and his administration was brief with the findings of """"Crimson Contagion"""", they still did nothing to prepare for a pandemic. Please google this

- People were encouraged to ingest horse dewormer and other unproven treatments  

- Suggestions to drink bleach and disinfectants circulated widely   

- Confusing guidance caused the spread of virus - “Don’t wear a mask,” quickly reversed to “Everyone should wear a mask”  

- Social distancing guidelines that kept changing, leaving the public uncertain    

- Anti-vaccine propaganda spreading across propaganda networks and social media, fueling distrust in science    

- Supply shortages of PPE, with frontline workers left unprotected   

- Vaccine rollout met with widespread misinformation campaigns   

- Leadership downplaying the virus, creating a false sense of security  

- Trump's China-virus rhetoric leading to assaults on Asian Americans 

- Toilet Paper shortages 

- Trump dismantled Obama's pandemic response team which led to a disaster 

- Despite reports of a pneumonia-like virus spreading in late OCT of 2019, the Trump administration still failed to meet the needs of the people with a proper plan

- Poison control centers reported an uptick in incidents after Trump's dangerous advice to drink bleach

- Trump told the American people that the virus would go away when the weather warmed up

- Poison control centers in several states reported increases in calls related to ivermectin overdoses

- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell alleged that the Obama administration did not provide the Trump administration with any playbook about the threat of a possible pandemic during a May 11, 2020 Team Trump Facebook Live discussion with Lara Trump

- Soon after McConnell made his playbook comment, Ronald Klain, the White House Ebola response coordinator from October 2014 to February 2015, tweeted out a link to a document titled “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents”

Ronny is himself very involved in the Trump-Vance campaign which has been going very hard on Walz for misrepresenting his rank.

Another thing Congressman Jackson has done is call out Kamala Harris for not """"answering tough questions that the American people deserve answers to!!""""

However, Congressman Jackson has refused to answer why he lies about his rank on multiple occasions when I have contacted his office.

I already posted this in the Texas Politics sub but I think it's important to share here too.

As we prepare for the upcoming elections, it's really important to dig into where our candidates are getting their support from and why it makes a difference. Based on **FACTS**.

Such as the significant donations Senator Ted Cruz receives from pro-Israel lobbyists.

[Track AIPAC most recent data shows $1,509,359](https://preview.redd.it/j32h5zy37n3d1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=e543c9dd84484ea315ec1335feaf2d9be39dfc60)

According to recent data, Senator Ted Cruz has received significant donations from pro-Israel lobbying groups, particularly AIPAC. As of the 2024 election cycle, **Cruz has received approximately $1,309,326 from these sources​** ([Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary?cycle=All&ind=Q05&recipdetail=S))​​ ([Track AIPAC](https://trackaipac.com/us-senate))​.

He's up for re-election this year and I think this information is critical for voters like us to understand where some of his campaign funding originates, especially when considering his stance and voting behavior on issues related to Israel.

Let me clarify that this discussion isn't about demonizing any group or undermining legitimate alliances. **It's about facing facts and considering what's best for our state and country**.","Dear fellow Texans, I already post this in the Texas politic sub but I think it's important to share here too.

I guess I'm just wondering if this is something that has happened to multiple people in Utah, because if so then something needs to change.

In June 2023, I (F26) was driving home alone at 2am and was pulled over by two cops because I had forgotten to turn on my headlights. They chatted with me for a second and then started asking if I had had anything to drink that night. I told them I hadn't had any alcohol for at least the past few days and was completely sober. They asked me to get out and do some field sobriety tests and kept asking about alcohol, getting increasingly aggressive and clearly not believing me. I didn't do amazing on the field sobriety tests because it was windy and I was shaking because the situation made me scared as it continued to escalate. Finally, they pulled out a breathalyzer and I felt relieved I could chemically prove I was sober. They looked at the result, then placed me under arrest for a DUI and put me in handcuffs. I pleaded with them that I was absolutely not under the influence of any substance. They then pivoted and started asking me about weed. I don't use weed at all and told them so, then they started asking about prescription drugs and I told them I don't use those either. Finally, the cop sighed and said he could charge me with a DUI even if I had no substance in my system. I didn't want to escalate anything and he seemed set on arresting me no matter what-- but I couldn't believe someone could be charged with a DUI if nothing is in their system? But he wouldn't lie to me about what the law is, right?

I was detained, my blood drawn, my car towed, and booked into the jail. I was in processing for 15 hours before I was released, the entire time terrified of the implications of this arrest, I've never gotten anything more serious than a speeding ticket and had no idea how to navigate the justice system. I had never experienced cops just not believing you and how helpless you feel when they steamroll you. 

When I got out I had to pay the tow yard around $375 to get my car back and had to pay the DMV $400 for the impound fee. I hired a lawyer and it took 10 weeks for the case to resolve-- it was ultimately thrown out as my blood showed I had no substance in my system. When I was able to read my police report, it said that outside of the field tests I seemed completely coherent. I thought maybe I had been acting weird and that's why they charged me, but all their notes made it clear I had been acting normal and while I didn't perform beautifully on the field tests I had done decently. So if I was acting normal, blew a zero on the breathalyzer, and did fair on the field sobriety tests-- why was I arrested? Did they really believe I was on something or were they just set on making the arrest regardless of what happened?

I'm just wondering if this is something other people in Utah have been through. We have a law that allows people to be charged with a """"metabolic DUI"""" which means if, once your blood is drawn, you are found to have ANY trace of a controlled substance or alcohol in your body then that DUI charge will hold up-- regardless of if you actually seem inebriated at the time of the arrest. But does that law leave way too much room for cops to just charge literally anyone with a DUI based on nothing? Does that leave them able to just profile people and charge them with a DUI based on their own biases?

Let me know if you know anyone who has had a similar experience, I really hope it's just a one off but I'm very curious. I know in 2013 there was a cop who was knowingly charging sober people with DUIs, it's possible that pattern is still prevalent among certain officers in the UHP today.","hello!

It's been 2 years since Roe V. Wade was overturned and since then, women have continued to have their reproductive rights ripped away from them.

But more than that, we are also fighting for equal rights, reproductive rights, human rights and to end gender-based violence and discrimination!

There are laws and bills being passed, and brought into play that would continue to harm us.

Enough is enough.

On the 24th at noon there will be a protest and march.
We will group up at the Capitol steps, have an 30 min-hour for any speakers to take the stand, then march down state street until we hit Washington square park, Where we will group up again.

Where we can we don't do anything, no work, no school, no buying. Make the government hear us!

Can't strike? Wear red.

This is an all age protest. I'm not running anything. Just helping to share the word.

The devastating floods of 2023 and 2024 have underscored the urgent need for systemic change in our state. While Governor Phil Scott has had several successful terms, his current focus and policies are not addressing the most pressing issues we face today.

In July 2023 and again in July 2024, Vermont was struck by severe flooding, displacing thousands and causing extensive damage. Despite the immediate relief efforts, the state's response has fallen short of addressing the root causes and long-term solutions needed to prevent such disasters (*StoryMaps, Vermont.gov*).

One of the critical issues is our housing policy. Thousands of Vermonters are losing their homes to these frequent floods, while the over-purchasing of vacation homes and short-term rentals continues unchecked. Strict zoning laws and building codes further hinder the development of affordable and resilient housing. These policies not only fail to protect our residents but also prioritize the interests of wealthy investors over those of our community (*Vermont.gov*).

Governor Scott has focused much of his efforts on issues that have already been settled, rather than directly addressing the housing crisis. While improving education is essential, the immediate need for better housing policies and addressing inflation and stagnant wages in Vermont is far more urgent. The current approach is leaving too many Vermonters vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters and economic pressures (*VT Digger*).

Although Governor Scott has had commendable successes, such as managing the COVID-19 pandemic and maintaining a steady economic hand during his tenure, his conservative and outdated policies are no longer sufficient. We need leadership that can drive Vermont towards a more resilient and prosperous future, capable of withstanding the increasing frequency of natural disasters and addressing the economic realities our residents face (*Seven Days*).

As we approach the upcoming elections, it is crucial to seek out and support candidates who are committed to enacting meaningful change. We need representatives who will fight for equitable housing policies and ensure that all Vermonters have access to safe, affordable, and resilient homes.

I urge you to share information about candidates running for office who have concrete plans to address these issues. What specific changes are they proposing to our zoning laws and building codes? How do they plan to ensure affordable and resilient housing for all Vermonters?

Your involvement and advocacy are vital. Together, we can push for the reforms needed to protect our communities and create a more just and resilient Vermont.

Thank you all for reading this and I hope that this will help myself, and others, find meaningful candidates that will represent meaningful change within this community.

* https://www.npr.org/2022/04/14/1084485963/florida-abortion-law-15-weeks

They promised to go no further, soundly won a supermajority, and the second the next term began, they rammed this shit through:

* https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ban-approved-c9c53311a0b2426adc4b8d0b463edad1#:~:text=April%2014%2C%202023-,TALLAHASSEE%2C%20Fla.,after%20six%20weeks%20of%20pregnancy.

A 6-week abortion ban complete with abortion pill restrictions. Virtually no debate, no accounting of polls despite them showing almost the whole state opposed it. They rammed it into law and are now attempting to implement it in court. 

Meanwhile in North Carolina, Republicans passed a 12-week abortion ban this summer:

* https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/north-carolina-12-week-abortion-ban-effect-20/story?id=100499149

This despite several newly elected North Carolina Rs saying they wouldn’t touch the state’s previous 20-week law before the last election only to vote for the 12-week limit. But that’s not all. NC Republicans control the state House and Senate, and their gubernatorial candidate next year has already come out in favor of amending their 12-week abortion ban to a 0 week abortion ban:

* https://www.wral.com/story/just-the-beginning-nc-republicans-say-more-abortion-restrictions-possible-after-2024-elections/20866150/

That’s right, a total ban. As the campaign really gets underway there, he’s softened his rhetoric to a holy compromise of a 6-week ban, which is a total abortion ban in fancy writing since most women don’t even know they’re pregnant at six weeks. 

Another problem with these “common ground” abortion bans has been that their exceptions beyond the allotted time period for things like the life of the mother have been comically vague, and with draconian penalties such as years in prison or life-crippling fines imposed for any doctors found guilty of an abortion that violates the bans, medical professionals have struggled to treat women under these exceptions clauses, leading to horror show instances like this:

* https://www.41nbc.com/florida-woman-traumatized-after-being-forced-to-carry-out-doomed-pregnancy/

This is the world Republicans now want to impose on Virginia. This is what their “common ground” compromise looks like in practice. It will cut thousands of mothers adrift and force them to suffer gruesome complications with no assistance, and they won’t stop with whatever “moderate” position they claim to want to impose on you this election. It’s just a starting point. 

Folks, don’t let Virginia become the next Florida. The time to fight back is NOW to prevent it from happening in the first place, not after Republicans gain the Trifecta and start imposing these changes on the population whether they like it or not (and almost certainly roll back the state’s voting laws so it’s harder to vote them out in future).

If you watch the news, the main reason why my son cannot come back is because of Korea not making any meaningful effort to enforce their own court orders to honor the treaty they signed with the Unites States called Hague convention.

It was nice until the last three years where I and the rest of my family started to notice how fake and for a lack of a better term, snobby people were. Ironically around this time was when we began looking at options for universities for me to attend, and one school that offered an amazing natural resources program was none other than Marshall University, only problem at the time was that it was in a state I saw as ‘maga’ and too conservative. 

Out of curiosity, I and my mother decided to visit the campus in Huntington. I would be lying to myself if I said I weren’t nervous to visit such a different place. Our country already being as divided as it is today, I didn’t anticipate an entirely warm welcome from the locals once they knew I was from the bluest state in the country.

Here is where my world turned around.

The kindness my mother and I were greeted with was overwhelming, and nothing like we have ever experienced during our ten years in California. A man walked all the way across a parking lot to help us load a couch into our car when we were moving furniture into our house, and that is something that just didn’t happen back in California.

A lot of this eased the hostility I had towards conservatives, and killed my belief that ALL conservatives are unhinged lunatics (there are a lot of them still in my opinion), and I became more open and comfortable talking to people I know are conservative and one can be without all the aggression which back then seemed impossible.

With the upcoming election and primaries around the corner, I wanted to share my view of this state as an outsider and can only hope that the next couple of years won’t turn the loving people of West Virginia against each other.

PS: there are many many many more reasons why we left Cali, but for me, the hospitality West Virginia had was too good to put aside.","I grow up in a small town name Moraga 30 minute from Oakland, CA.

Or if not, sorry if this is inappropriate. Just wondering if there's any other kindred souls out there. 

I was raised here for my entire life. My parents aren't from here, but moved here to raise me. They thought it'd be safer. My town population is in the two thousands, and I have no neighbors. Never wanted to live here, would beg my mom to move back to the city when I was a kid. Local things were lost on my family. I didn't make many friends in school. My parents didn't have any friends either. I was always the weird kid, or the quiet kid. Had unusual interests and by the time high school happened I realized I was LGBT in several ways, so that in no way helped. Never was an outdoors person, so most of the things to do around here were lost on me. Raised Christian until that miserably failed (being myself in such a prejudiced area direly shook my faith in Christianity). 

Now in college and young adulthood, I find myself unable to relate to really anyone. I'm still going to college here. Haven't made any friends that really seem like my people. Most of my socialization and life is spent online because I feel so out of touch with this area. Most friends I've had in my life, and even romantic partners, have all been from out-of-state and/or long distance. I can't see myself getting romantically involved or even just intellectually intimate with anyone in my area. I can't see myself getting involved with anyone until I leave. I've been trying to meet new people. I've been joining clubs, going to hang out with people I don't usually go out with, even exploring Tinder, but I've yet to found anyone who shares my interests or worldview, and that's all I really want at this point. 

There's something about the diversity of people here that is severely lacking, in my experience. It's gotten to the point where I don't feel I fit in with anybody at all. City people don't understand the rural isolation, weren't raised with that in mind—or if they were unusual in any way, they likely had an easier time finding like-minded people. Any other 'weird' people around here are not 'weird' in the way I am. There is an inferior complex-esque instinct in me that says I don't have a place around well-adjusted people, so I tend to avoid them by default. These are the kind of isolating thoughts I get, whether to my own detriment or not. 

I've been trying to get better about it, approaching interesting people, instead of letting those opportunities pass me by. It's just hard. I have trust issues these days, and little energy. That's off-topic. This post is really for the people that have never been happy here at all. The ones who can't adapt or make do, or well up any sense of love for this place, except for the familiarity one might feel with an old enemy. 

Maybe these types of people won't be on a subreddit for the state, but I believe West Virginia creates a very unique feeling of loneliness that is exclusive to it. I'm sorry if this post is pretentious in any way. It's not mean to be. It's coming from a place of genuine isolation.","I'm sure this place get post like this all the time.

It’s one of the best ways to get away from life and just clear your head, and just listen to what you want. Whether that be my Pink Floyd playlist, or my favorite book series for the 57th time. 

And while I’m on these drives, I always take time to look at our beautiful landscapes. And those landscapes are so beautiful because of our farmers. I love seeing all the fields of corn, and soybeans, and corn, and cows, and corn, oh and corn. We grow a lot of corn. 

But y’know, it’s incredible, and amazingly beautiful that our farmers can grow crops on their own land, harvest them at their own time, and sell them however they want without having to answer to their corporate masters. Isn’t it wonderful? 

Too bad Donald Trump doesn’t see it that way. 

Trump supports big egg, dairy, and produce, because they have the money to fill his bank account. And let’s get down to brass tacks, if there is a small industry that has a corporate counterpart, he will support it bar none. 

I’ve said this many times, but Donald Trump wouldn’t walk across the room to have a drink with anyone who isn’t in his circle, even if they were the last person on earth. All because he doesn’t care about us. And that’s to say nothing of JD Vance. 

He is a disgrace to the Midwest, because he hates his origins but he still profits off of it through his joke of a book. And by the way, the fact that he went to Yale, and served in the military is irrelevant when he’s going around lying about his opponent for “stolen valor”, which is such bs. 

Yesterday in Eau Claire, both Kamala Harris/Tim Walz & JD Vance had rallies not 15 miles away from each other. Vance’s rally was held in a manufacturing facility owned by a billionaire. Harris’s rally was out in a field where they put on Country Jam. Vance’s rally had just over 100 attendees not including press. Harris’s had over 12,000, and people had to be turned away because the venue had reached capacity. 

To me at least, this sends a clear and direct message to the republicans, and it is this: The vast majority of Americans are sick and tired of this man taking over our country, and Donald Trump should TAKE THE DAMN HINT.

Edit: I fixed the brass tacks, and corrected Vance’s campaign location. It was still less than 15 miles away, and there were members of the public there. And it was at a place owned by a billionaire, so same difference. I also deleted the “whatever the hell that means” bit, and changed it to “which is such bs”.

>Wyoming’s Congressional delegates told Cowboy State Daily that’s nonsense, and that Biden’s border patrol has not been doing its job.  

>“The Biden administration wants to open the floodgates for cartels, drug dealers, gangs and terror suspects,” Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming’s senior Republican delegate to the U.S. Senate, told Cowboy State Daily in a Wednesday email.  

>Barrasso took it a step further, saying it’s Texas, not the federal agents, that is defending the southern border., and that it has “every right” to do so.

>Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said the border crisis “could be ended tomorrow if President Biden enforced existing laws on the books, finished the border wall and brought back highly effective Trump-era policies such as Remain in Mexico.”  

>She said the Biden administration has chosen the “open border” and “is shamefully choosing to put America last.”  

>Texas, meanwhile, is doubling down by raising even more razor wire and sending its state soldiers to police the border.  

>**A Little Constitutional Law**

>U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar cited the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which makes the Constitution and federal laws crafted pursuant to it the “supreme law of the land.” 

>She said the lower court’s order — now vacated — that prevented Border Patrol agents from cutting the razor wire inverted the Supremacy Clause “by requiring federal law to yield to Texas law.  

>Wyoming’s lone delegate to the U.S. House, Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman, countered, saying the federal government has violated the Constitution by disregarding the Guarantee Clause.  That portion says that the United States will guarantee to its states a republican form of government, and will protect each of them from invasion.  

>“Texas has this right (to defend the border) because the Biden administration is violating the Constitution,” Hageman told Cowboy State Daily on Wednesday. “This entire situation says far more about the willful dereliction of border security by Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas than anything else – actually having razor wire cut and barriers removed? It doesn’t sound like an administration that wants to secure our border in any way.” 

>**Here’s Some More Razor Wire**
 
>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott agrees with Hageman’s analysis, according to a public statement he dispatched Wednesday.  

>“The failure of the Bident administration to fulfill (these duties) has triggered (a clause giving) this state the right of self-defense,” wrote Abbott.
He’s declared an invasion and has authorized his agencies to act on their authority to secure the Texas border, the statement says.  

>Abbott doubled down after the Supreme Court’s Monday order, deploying state troops and miles and miles of razor wire.  

>To be clear, the high court’s order doesn’t bar Texas from putting up razor wire, it simply allows federal agents to cut the wire while the lawsuit is ongoing.
  
>Abbott posted photos Tuesday to his personal page on X.com (formerly Twitter), showing Texas National Guard soldiers staring out at the river through loops of tangled wire. 

>**Five Justices On Monday**

>The Biden administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 2, to vacate a lower court’s order stopping federal agents from cutting razor wire the Texas Military Department raised on private property in Eagle Pass, a border town and the “epicenter” of migrant influx.
  
>The high court sided with Biden in a 5-4 split. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the liberal-leaning justices in vacating the lower court’s injunction.

>Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would have denied the order favoring the Biden administration.
  
>But the case, Texas v. Department of Homeland Security, which Texas filed in October, has yet to be heard on its merits and is not final. The case contemplates whether federal agents break Texas law by destroying its property, the razor wire.  

…

>**Nah, Says Texas**

>Texas argued back Jan. 9, calling the federal government “duplicitous” and saying the agencies aren’t fulfilling the duties they say justify the wire-cutting.  

>“The evidence presented … amply demonstrates the utter failure of the Defendants to deter, prevent and halt unlawful entry,” says Texas’ response. They can’t “seek judicial blessing of practices that both directly contravene those same statutory obligations and require the destruction of (Texas’) property.”  

>Texas cited an “explosion” of immigration, much of it illegal. Thousands of people enter Texas daily. The annual number of Border Patrol encounters with migrants in the act of entering illegal swelled from 458,000 in 2020 to 2.4 million in 2022, the response says.  

>Texas also cited the growing industry of Mexican drug cartels, now the fifth-largest employer in Mexico and a lucrative business thriving on lax border policing.   

>**Back Off**

>Texas agents clashed with Customs and Border Patrol agents in October, when the Texans noticed the federal officials cutting the fencing. 
 
>Texas officers tried to document “this ongoing destruction,” and federal agents told them to “back the f*** off,” says the response.  

>Later, the federal agents traded the bolt cutters for an industrial-strength forklift to upheave the fence. They held the fence in the air for 20 minutes on Oct. 26, letting 300 people rush under it from the Mexico side, says the filing.  
None of those people appeared to be in distress, reportedly.  

>**Three Drowned**

>One woman and two children drowned in the Rio Grande this month on the Mexico side of the border outside Eagle Pass.  

>The federal government claims it could not save the three people because it could not access the border, while the Texas Military Department says Border Patrol agents didn’t even ask for access to the border until the drownings were over and Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies.",">To earn permission to cut down razor wire Texas raise along the Mexican border, the Biden administration tell the U.
